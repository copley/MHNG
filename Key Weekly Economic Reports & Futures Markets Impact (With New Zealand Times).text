### **For Natural Gas, the Most Relevant Weekly Economic Report:**
#### **EIA Natural Gas Storage Report**
- **Release Time (ET):** Every Thursday at 10:30 AM ET
- **Release Time (NZT):** Friday at 4:30 AM NZT
- **Impact on Natural Gas Futures (NG):**
  - **Larger-than-expected build (more supply) → Bearish (natural gas prices drop)**
  - **Larger-than-expected draw (higher demand/lower supply) → Bullish (natural gas prices rise)**

Does it always move the market?
- Most of the time, yes. If the actual storage change deviates significantly from expectations, you will see an immediate price reaction in Natural Gas futures (NG).
- However, if the report aligns with expectations, the market reaction may be muted.

### **Other Reports & Their Relevance to Natural Gas**

#### **EIA Petroleum Status Report** (Wednesdays, 10:30 AM ET / Thursdays, 4:30 AM NZT)
- **Not directly relevant to Natural Gas.**
- Primarily affects Crude Oil (WTI & Brent).
- However, if oil inventories rise or fall sharply, there can be some correlation between oil and natural gas prices due to energy demand shifts.

#### **API Weekly Statistical Bulletin** (Tuesdays, 4:30 PM ET / Wednesdays, 10:30 AM NZT)
- **Not a primary driver of Natural Gas.**
- Mostly impacts Crude Oil prices ahead of the EIA Petroleum Status Report.

#### **USDA Export Sales Report** (Thursdays, 8:30 AM ET / Fridays, 2:30 AM NZT)
- **No direct impact on Natural Gas.**
- This report mainly affects agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soybeans).

#### **Initial Jobless Claims** (Thursdays, 8:30 AM ET / Fridays, 2:30 AM NZT)
- **Minimal short-term impact on Natural Gas.**
- Can influence overall market sentiment but does not directly move NG futures unless it significantly affects macroeconomic conditions.

#### **Commitments of Traders (COT) Report** (Fridays, 3:30 PM ET / Saturdays, 9:30 AM NZT)
- **Useful for long-term positioning but not for short-term trades.**
- It shows institutional positioning in Natural Gas futures, helping traders gauge sentiment.

### **Final Verdict:**
For Natural Gas, the **EIA Natural Gas Storage Report** (**Thursdays, 10:30 AM ET / Fridays, 4:30 AM NZT**) is the most accurate, reliable, and consistently market-moving report. The others primarily impact crude oil, stocks, and agricultural commodities rather than natural gas.
