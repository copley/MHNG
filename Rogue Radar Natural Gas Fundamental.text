Here’s how you might interpret the numbers and the Production‐vs.‐Consumption chart to inform natural‐gas trading decisions:

1. Spot the Supply‐Demand Balance at a Glance
Total US Supply is shown as around 110.7 Bcfd, driven mostly by dry‐gas production plus net Canadian imports.
Total US Demand (including domestic consumption, pipeline fuel, exports to Mexico, and LNG exports) sits at 110.0 Bcfd.
The difference—about +0.7 Bcfd—suggests a slight surplus, which implies marginal injections into storage (i.e., 0.7 Bcfd Implied Storage addition).
Trading Takeaway:
A modest surplus typically points to potential downward or sideways pressure on prices—unless something changes demand (e.g., cold snap) or supply (e.g., well freeze‐offs).

2. Watch Production vs. Consumption Trends Over Time
In the chart, Production (blue line) is usually above Consumption (yellow line), but look carefully at trends:

Has production just dipped (−0.7 Bcfd change) from a previous month or is it part of a bigger downward slope?
Did consumption also drop (−4.1 Bcfd change), and is that trend continuing or reversing?
Trading Takeaway:
If production trends start declining more steeply (or consumption rebounds strongly), you might see a supply deficit emerge, potentially bullish for price. On the other hand, if production remains robust while consumption flattens, the market can stay well supplied or even oversupplied.

3. Consider the Export Breakdown
LNG Exports total around −15.8 Bcfd, which reduces domestic supply.
Mexico Exports at −6.1 Bcfd further tighten the US market.
Although these exports are included in total demand, watching how they move over time can give early clues. For instance, rising global LNG demand can drive up US LNG exports, tightening the domestic market and supporting prices.

4. Mind the Storage Trajectory
The net 0.7 Bcfd that ends up in storage suggests a steady or slight build. But remember:

A small injection now might still leave storage below (or above) seasonal norms. You’ll want to compare this with 5‐year averages or other storage metrics (like the “NG Working Gas Storage” charts often available).
If unexpected demand spikes (e.g., severe winter) or if production is disrupted, storage can quickly flip to withdrawals—and that can push prices higher.
Trading Takeaway:
Use weekly or monthly changes to confirm whether inventory builds are accelerating or slowing. A switch from “mild injection” to “larger than expected withdrawal” often triggers price volatility.

5. Factor in Timing, Weather, and Macro Conditions
Seasonality: A small surplus in a shoulder season (spring/fall) might be more bearish than the same surplus heading into peak winter demand.
Weather Forecasts: If a cold front hits while you have only a wafer‐thin surplus, price can spike.
Rig Counts & Drilling Activity: Production can lag changes in drilling activity by months, but watching those data can confirm if the current production dip is short‐term or indicative of a longer trend.
6. Synthesize It All for a Position Bias
Bullish Setup if you see:
Production declining more than expected.
Demand (domestic or export) picking up.
Storage increasingly drawing down.
Bearish/Neutral Setup if you see:
Production holding steady or rising.
Seasonal demand weaker than normal.
Storage still getting net injections above historical averages.
Putting It All Together
Use the Production vs. Consumption chart alongside the numeric breakdown (supply, demand, exports, etc.) to gauge whether the market is trending toward surplus or deficit. Confirm those signals with other fundamentals (weather, storage levels relative to 5‐year averages, rig counts). If the data consistently point toward tightening supply/demand, you might lean bullish; if they indicate comfortable supply or growing surpluses, you might lean bearish or look for short setups. This holistic approach can help you better anticipate price moves rather than reacting after they happen.

1. Gauge LNG’s Impact on Domestic Supply
Rising Net Exports (i.e., US is shipping out more LNG than it imports) means that more gas is leaving the domestic market, tightening supply and potentially supporting higher prices.
Falling Net Exports would suggest less gas is flowing out. All else equal, this leaves more gas in the US market and can weigh on prices.
Practical Use:
Monitor changes or trends in LNG net exports. For example, an uptick in exports going into a heavy‐demand period (winter heating or summer power generation) is often bullish for domestic prices, especially if overall production and storage levels aren’t keeping pace.

2. Assess Storage Levels vs. Historical Benchmarks
Working Gas Storage tracks how much gas is currently in underground storage across the US. The chart usually compares the current year (often in green) with the 5‐year average, plus a range of 5‐year min and max levels.
If current storage is below the 5‐year average (and net exports are high or growing), that points to a tighter supply picture—often supportive of higher prices.
If current storage is above or near the top of the 5‐year range, there’s more buffer against weather or export‐driven demand spikes, which can soften price volatility.
Practical Use:

Check whether inventories are being built faster or slower than the 5‐year average. A slower rate of injections during “injection season” (summer/fall) or a faster rate of withdrawals in winter could help confirm a bullish bias. Conversely, large and persistent injections or milder withdrawals can temper prices.
3. Combine Both for Supply‐Demand Insights
High LNG Exports + Low Storage: Points to a potentially bullish setup if demand (e.g., winter heating, industrial usage) rises at the same time.
Low LNG Exports + Above‐Average Storage: Suggests looser market conditions, potentially capping or depressing prices.
4. Watch Key Market Catalysts for Confirmation
Weather Forecasts: Heating and cooling demand can quickly change storage draws/injections and real‐time price direction.
Global LNG Market Developments: Changes in European or Asian LNG demand can alter US net exports.
EIA Weekly Reports / Rig Counts: Keep an eye on official data releases that may confirm or refute trends you see in the charts.
Using these charts side by side helps you see whether domestic storage can cover the extra draw from LNG exports and seasonal demand surges—or if a shortfall might develop. Integrating that insight with other market data (production, weather, storage reports) lets you form a more complete picture of where prices may be headed.

These two charts can help you gauge how U.S. natural‐gas (NG) supply and demand might be evolving over time—and ultimately how that might affect NG prices. While no single graph can tell you exactly where prices will go, integrating the information they contain with other market indicators can strengthen your fundamental analysis. Below is a brief overview of how one might interpret them for trading decisions:

1. Understanding Net Exports vs. Imports
Chart: NG Pipeline NET Exports

Pipeline Exports (blue area): Higher exports generally reduce domestic supply—potentially bullish for U.S. natural‐gas prices if other factors (e.g., production rates) stay the same.
Pipeline Imports (yellow area): Rising imports add to domestic supply—potentially weighing on prices if demand doesn’t absorb that extra supply.
Net Exports (white line): This is the difference (Exports – Imports). A persistently positive and rising net‐export figure means U.S. natural‐gas is flowing out of the country at a higher rate, which can tighten the domestic market. If net exports weaken or turn negative, it suggests an easing supply‐demand balance domestically.
How to use it:

Watch if the net‐export line is trending upward (more bullish) or downward (less bullish).
Compare the trend in exports or imports to upcoming seasonal demand (e.g., winter heating season, summer power burn). A spike in exports during peak demand periods can intensify price movements.
2. Tracking Consumption by Sector
Chart: NG Consumption (stacked by sector)

This chart breaks down total natural‐gas consumption among several major end‐use sectors:

Residential (teal/purple or another highlighted color): Often spikes in colder months due to heating demand.
Commercial (often a different band of color): Also tends to rise in cooler seasons for heating.
Industrial (green): Fairly steady, with some sensitivity to economic activity and industrial processes.
Electric (orange): Often peaks during summer cooling demand (for air‐conditioning) and can also spike in winter if gas‐fired power generation is high.
Others (like Plant & Lease Fuel, Pipeline Distribution): Typically smaller but still relevant segments.
How to use it:

Identify seasonal trends: For example, if the winter residential heating bump appears especially large this year, that could be supportive of higher prices—assuming supplies don’t expand at the same pace.
Spot anomalies: If industrial demand jumps unexpectedly or electric‐power demand remains unseasonably high, that could indicate tightening supply and higher short‐term prices.
Look for divergences: A rising total consumption trend (all sectors combined) in tandem with rising net exports is especially bullish, as both domestic demand and foreign demand are drawing on the same supply.
3. Combining the Two Charts in Your Analysis
Supply Tightening vs. Demand Surges:
If you see net exports growing (exports up, imports down) at the same time that domestic consumption is trending upward, that signals a tighter supply/demand balance and can support higher prices.

Seasonality:
Natural gas markets are strongly influenced by weather (winter for heating and summer for air‐conditioning). By matching the consumption chart’s seasonal changes with the net‐export chart, you can anticipate where supply may become constrained—or possibly over‐supplied.

Forward Look:
If projections show continuing high exports or an expected jump in one of the end‐use sectors (e.g., electric generation) coinciding with below‐average storage or production levels, prices may get a boost.

4. Practical Tips (with a Caveat)
Set Price Alerts and Watch Other Indicators: Keep an eye on natural‐gas storage reports, rig counts, and weather forecasts. These charts are a valuable piece of the puzzle but are most effective when combined with broader market data.
Compare Trends Over Multiple Months: One month’s spike may be temporary noise—be sure to confirm a change in trend before leaning too heavily into a trade.
Use Technical Analysis for Timing: The charts here are fundamentally driven. For entry/exit timing, many traders overlay fundamental insights with technical price‐chart patterns.
Finally, it’s important to remember that natural‐gas trading can be volatile, and no single metric guarantees a successful trade. Using these charts to understand broad supply and demand forces—especially in conjunction with weather, production, and storage data—can help you make more informed decisions. Always do your own research and consider seeking professional advice to tailor these observations to your specific trading strategy.

Below are a few ways to interpret these two charts and integrate them into a trading approach for CME‐listed natural‐gas contracts (e.g., NG, MHNG):

1. Henry Hub Annual Strip Price (Left Chart)
What it Shows

This bar chart illustrates the annual “strip” prices for each future year (e.g., 2025 through 2030). Each bar is effectively the average of monthly Henry Hub futures prices over that calendar year.
How to Use It

Long‐Term Price Outlook

The strip tells you how the market currently prices natural gas for each future year—helpful for gauging longer‐term sentiment.
If future strips are significantly higher than the prompt (nearby) contract, it suggests a contango (an upward‐sloping forward curve), often tied to expectations of stronger demand or constraints on future supply. A backwardated curve (higher near‐term prices, lower out‐years) may signal tightness now but more comfortable supply in the longer run.
Hedging or Spread Trades

Producers may hedge forward production if they see out‐year strips at attractive levels.
Speculators or hedgers can consider calendar spreads: going long/short different strips (e.g., selling 2025 strip while buying 2027 if you think the curve will flatten).
Relative Value

Compare the out‐year strip to your own fundamental outlook. If you believe the market is underestimating future LNG exports or underestimating supply constraints, you might lean bullish on distant contracts. Conversely, if you see robust production growth, you may see the out‐year strips as overpriced.
2. Nat Gas Moving Averages (Right Chart)
What it Shows

This chart plots the front‐month (or nearby) natural‐gas futures price against several moving averages:
9‐day MA (often a short‐term indicator)
20‐day MA (intermediate trend)
50‐day MA (longer‐term trend)
Possibly a line for Last Price as well.
How to Use It

Trend and Momentum

If the price is above its moving averages, that generally indicates a bullish trend; below MAs can signify a bearish phase.
Look for crossovers: for example, if the shorter‐term average (9‐day) crosses above the longer‐term average (20‐ or 50‐day), that can be read as bullish momentum picking up.
Support/Resistance Levels

Moving averages often serve as dynamic support or resistance. You can watch how price reacts when it tests, say, the 20‐day MA—does it bounce or break?
Short‐Term vs. Longer‐Term Signals

The 9‐day average responds quickly to new price action (useful in volatile swings).
The 50‐day is smoother and can help confirm if there’s a sustained trend change rather than a short‐lived move.
3. Putting It All Together for Trading Decisions
Combine the Long‐Term Strip View with Near‐Term Trend Signals

If the near‐term charts (MAs) suggest bullish momentum is building and the forward strip is rising—or sits above current spot prices—you may have confluence for a longer‐term bullish position.
Conversely, if the spot market is breaking down below key moving averages (bearish short‐term trend) yet out‐year strips remain high, you might look for spread opportunities or a potential correction in the strip.
Identify Opportunity Windows

The forward strip (annual bar chart) gives you a big‐picture “macro” perspective for months or years ahead.
The moving averages chart offers “micro” timing cues for the next few days or weeks. Together, they can help you see if short‐term momentum aligns (or conflicts) with long‐term pricing views.
Risk Management and Confirmation

Use other fundamental data—like storage reports, production changes, and export trends—to confirm whether the near‐term price action (moving averages) aligns with the broader supply/demand outlook signaled by the strip.
Watch volatility and option premiums in these different time frames. High implied volatility in the near‐term might open opportunities for options strategies, while calmer out‐year markets might be better suited for straightforward futures hedging.
Final Thoughts
Annual strips are great for grasping the market’s longer‐term expectations and for planning multi‐month or multi‐year strategies (hedging or investing).
Moving averages are a tried‐and‐true technique for tracking short‐ to medium‐term trends, which helps refine trade timing and risk control.
Always integrate these visuals with other fundamentals (weather forecasts, EIA reports, pipeline flows) and technical tools (support/resistance, volume analysis) for the most robust decision‐making.


Here are some ways you can use the Bollinger Band chart (left) and the Pivot Levels table (right) to guide trading decisions in natural‐gas futures (CME Henry Hub NG, mini NG, etc.):

1. Bollinger Bands for Volatility & “Overbought/Oversold” Signals
Bollinger Bands typically consist of:

A middle band (often a 20‐day moving average),
An upper band (e.g., +2 standard deviations above the MA),
A lower band (−2 standard deviations below the MA).
In your chart:

White Line = 20‐day moving average (center),
Blue Line = Bollinger max (upper band),
Orange Line = Bollinger min (lower band),
Yellow Line = Last price.
How to use them:

Volatility Gauge
When bands widen, volatility is increasing; when they narrow (“squeeze”), volatility is decreasing. A “Bollinger Squeeze” sometimes precedes a sharp price move.
Potential Reversal Zones
Price trading near the upper band can be in an overbought region—sometimes a signal the market might pull back, or at least slow its advance. Conversely, price near the lower band can be considered oversold.
Trend Continuation vs. Reversion
If price continuously hugs the upper band during a strong uptrend, it’s often a momentum signal—exiting or shorting just because price touches the band can be premature. Watch how price behaves around the middle band (the 20‐day MA) to confirm whether an existing trend is intact.
2. Pivot Points for Short‐Term Support & Resistance
Pivot points (P, R1, R2, S1, S2) are calculated from the prior day’s (or week’s) high, low, and close. They’re widely used by short‐term traders to identify where price might pause or reverse.

Your table lists:

Settle (previous settlement): 4.104
R2: 4.248
R1: 4.176
Pivot: 4.069
S1: 3.997
S2: 3.89
How to use them:

Directional Bias
If price opens or moves above the pivot (P = 4.069) and stays there, many traders see that as intraday bullish, targeting R1 or R2 as upside objectives.
If price moves below P, focus shifts to S1 or S2 as possible downside targets.
Potential Support/Resistance
S1, S2 can act like support zones, where buyers might step in.
R1, R2 can act like resistance zones, where sellers might show up or profit‐taking could start.
Setting Stop/Profit Levels
Pivot points are handy for placing stops or take‐profit orders near these known inflection areas.
3. Combining Bollinger Bands and Pivot Levels
Look for Confluence: If price is testing a pivot‐point resistance (e.g., R1) and simultaneously tapping the upper Bollinger band, that could strengthen the case for a near‐term pullback.
Momentum Confirmation: If price breaks above R2 and is also riding the upper Bollinger band in a strong uptrend, that may confirm bullish momentum.
Mean Reversion vs. Trend Trading: Pivot levels often pair well with Bollinger Bands if you’re seeking quick swing trades around potential support/resistance. Meanwhile, if price is trending steadily outside of Bollinger “middle band,” pivot levels can help locate profit targets.
4. Practical Tips
Watch for Volatility Shifts: A Bollinger “squeeze” plus price nearing a pivot point often signals an impending directional move—prepare for a breakout or breakdown.
Use in Conjunction with Fundamentals: Especially in natural gas, weather forecasts, storage data, and export/import news can override technical signals.
Combine with Other Technicals: Confirm pivot‐point bounces or Bollinger‐band reversals with volume spikes, candlestick patterns, or momentum oscillators (RSI, MACD).
Final Thoughts
Bollinger Bands help visualize typical volatility ranges, showing when price may be extended or undergoing a momentum push.
Pivot Points offer clear, short‐term levels of potential support/resistance for planning entries and exits.
Integrating both—alongside fundamental drivers like seasonal demand, storage reports, and LNG exports—will give you a more well‐rounded view before taking a position in NG or MHNG contracts.


Below is how you can interpret the MACD (left chart) and RSI (right chart) for the Natural Gas market—and combine them for better trading decisions:

1. MACD (Left Chart)
What It Shows

The MACD Line (blue) and the Signal Line (orange).
MACD Crossovers are classic buy/sell signals:
Bullish Crossover: Blue (MACD) rises above orange (Signal).
Bearish Crossover: Blue (MACD) drops below orange (Signal).
How to Use It

Entry/Exit Signals
A bullish crossover can be taken as a buy signal or a reason to cover shorts.
A bearish crossover can be used to sell or initiate shorts.
Trend Confirmation
Check the MACD histogram (difference between MACD Line and Signal Line) if available. A rising histogram suggests bullish momentum is growing; a falling histogram suggests momentum is weakening.
Filter With a Higher Time Frame
If you see a bullish crossover on the daily chart but the weekly chart’s MACD is still in a bearish stance, you might exercise caution or wait for alignment across time frames.
2. RSI (Right Chart)
What It Shows

A Relative Strength Index (RSI) line (white).
Two boundary lines:
Overbought level (orange), above which the RSI indicates potential over‐extension.
Oversold level (blue), below which RSI indicates a potential oversold condition.
Typical RSI Ranges

Above 70 or 80 is often deemed overbought, where price may be vulnerable to a pullback.
Below 30 or 20 is often deemed oversold, where price may be due for a rebound.
How to Use It

Mean‐Reversion Signals
If RSI crosses above the orange line, it’s overbought territory—some traders tighten stops, take partial profits, or look for a short entry if other signs confirm a reversal.
If RSI falls below the blue line, the market is oversold—some traders watch for a bounce or bullish candlestick pattern to enter long.
Trend vs. Oscillator
In a strong uptrend, RSI can remain overbought for extended periods—don’t automatically short just because RSI crosses above 70/80.
In a strong downtrend, RSI can stay in oversold territory for a while.
3. Combining MACD & RSI
Momentum + Overbought/Oversold
A MACD bullish crossover while RSI emerges from an oversold zone (below blue) can give extra confidence in a long setup.
A MACD bearish crossover when RSI is overbought might confirm a short or profit‐taking opportunity.
Check for Divergences
If price makes new highs but RSI or MACD do not, that “bearish divergence” can signal a looming reversal.
If price makes lower lows but RSI or MACD do not, that “bullish divergence” can indicate potential upside ahead.
4. Practical Application in NG Trading
Entry Timing
Use MACD crossovers or RSI extremes as a timing mechanism to enter in the direction of your broader fundamental/seasonal bias (e.g., bullish in winter, or if you anticipate supply shortages).
Stop/Profit Placement
When RSI nears overbought, consider raising stops or scaling out of positions. If it plunges into oversold, watch for signs of stabilization to initiate or add to longs.
Combine with Fundamentals
Natural Gas is highly sensitive to weather, storage reports, and LNG exports. A technical “buy signal” can be more potent if fundamentals also point bullish (e.g., cold snap forecast). Conversely, a technical “sell signal” that conflicts with an unexpectedly bullish EIA storage report may fail quickly.
Bottom Line:

MACD helps track momentum shifts via crossovers.
RSI flags potential overbought/oversold conditions.
Together, they can improve your trade timing—particularly when either confirms the other or aligns with solid fundamentals. Always manage risk carefully, as these indicators are not guarantees but rather tools to gauge probability in the natural‐gas market’s frequent volatility.
