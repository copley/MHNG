Below is a comprehensive summary of the key concepts, data sources, and example logic you can hand over to a software engineer to build out a weather-driven natural gas price analysis tool. This write-up distills the information from our previous discussion and includes:

Why there is no single zip code that moves the market (the role of population centers).
Weather metrics (Heating Degree Days) and how they correlate with natural gas demand.
Free or freemium APIs for weather data, plus ways to approximate pipeline flows, real-time consumption, and weekly storage levels.
Pseudo-code / extended Python code that demonstrates how these data might be combined to produce a simple bullish/bearish signal.
1. Conceptual Overview
1.1. No Single ‚ÄúKey Zip Code‚Äù
Natural gas demand (and thus price movement) in winter correlates with aggregate heating needs across large population hubs‚Äîespecially in the Northeast Corridor (NYC, Boston, Philly) and Midwest (Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, etc.).
Takeaway: You gather forecasts for multiple major cities or regions, not just one zip code.
1.2. Heating Degree Days (HDD)
Definition: HDD estimates how much heating is needed given a baseline temperature (usually 65¬∞F). If the day‚Äôs average temperature is below 65¬∞F, HDD goes up.
Formula:
HDD
=
max
‚Å°
(
0
,
65
‚àò
ùêπ
‚àí
Avg¬†Daily¬†Temp
)
HDD=max(0,65 
‚àò
 F‚àíAvg¬†Daily¬†Temp)
Importance: Higher HDD means higher heating demand ‚Üí bullish for natural gas (all else being equal).
1.3. Infrastructure & Storage Constraints
Pipelines into the Northeast or Midwest can face capacity constraints during cold snaps, amplifying price spikes.
Storage levels also matter; if storage is low heading into winter, any sign of extreme cold can cause a bigger rally in prices.
1.4. Putting It All Together
Gather multi-city weather forecasts (to compute HDD).
Weight each city‚Äôs HDD by population or gas consumption share.
Compare the aggregated HDD to historical averages and prior-day forecasts.
Look at storage (from EIA data), pipeline flows (if you can scrape or approximate them), and real-time consumption info (if available).
Generate a signal (e.g., ‚ÄúBUY‚Äù if much colder than normal / low storage, ‚ÄúSELL‚Äù if milder).
2. Data Sources & APIs
Here are the main free or freemium data sources you can tap into. The software engineer can use these to build the data-ingestion pipeline.

2.1. Weather Forecasts for Major Cities
OpenWeatherMap

Website: https://openweathermap.org/api
Key Points:
Freemium tier (limited calls per day).
Directly query by zip code or city name (must specify the country code if outside the US).
Data You Get: 5-day or longer forecasts in 3-hour increments.
NOAA / National Weather Service (NWS) API

Website: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api
Key Points:
Free U.S. government data.
Often requires latitude/longitude instead of zip codes; you can convert zip to lat/long with a free geocoding service (e.g., PositionStack).
Weatherbit

Website: https://www.weatherbit.io/api
Key Points:
Similar freemium structure.
Also supports zip code or city queries.
Recommendation: For simplicity, start with OpenWeatherMap‚Äôs free tier. If you have more advanced needs, NOAA is a good ‚Äúofficial‚Äù alternative (though you‚Äôll do more data parsing on your side).

2.2. Natural Gas Storage, Consumption, and Pipeline Data
EIA Open Data API (Free)

Website: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/
Why Use It:
Weekly storage data by region (published Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. ET).
Monthly or weekly consumption, production, and import/export data.
How to Use:
Register for a free API key.
Search for relevant ‚Äúseries IDs‚Äù in EIA‚Äôs API browser.
Example: NG.NW2_EPG0_SWO_R48_BCF.W ‚Üí Weekly Working Gas in Storage, Lower 48.
FERC Pipeline Bulletins

Website: https://www.ferc.gov
Key Points:
FERC mandates interstate pipelines to post daily or intraday capacity/flow info on their own ‚ÄúElectronic Bulletin Boards.‚Äù
No single aggregated free API. You‚Äôd have to scrape or parse each pipeline‚Äôs website separately.
Pipeline Operator ‚ÄúInfo Posts‚Äù (Scraping)

Examples:
Transco (Williams)
Texas Eastern (Enbridge)
Tennessee Gas Pipeline (Kinder Morgan)
Challenge: Each site may have a different structure. No standardized API.
Strategy: If you only care about a few key pipelines, you can build custom scrapers or gather CSV/Excel files if provided.
3. Logic to Implement (Step-by-Step)
Below is the high-level algorithm that captures how analysts use this data to place orders. You can hand these steps to your engineer to build a coherent workflow:

Identify Cities & Weights

Make a list of major winter-prone metro areas. For example:
python
Copy
cities = [
  {"name": "New York", "zip": "10001", "pop_weight": 0.15},
  {"name": "Chicago", "zip": "60606", "pop_weight": 0.10},
  {"name": "Boston", "zip": "02108", "pop_weight": 0.05},
  # ...
]
pop_weight is a rough fraction of total gas usage or population among your selected cities.
Fetch Weather Data

Use OpenWeatherMap (or NOAA) to get daily or 3-hour increment forecasts for each city‚Äôs zip code.
Parse out the forecasted temperatures (e.g., average daily temps for the next 7 days).
Compute Heating Degree Days (HDD)

For each day, HDD = max(0, 65 - average_temp_in_F).
If you have 3-hour increments, average them across 24 hours for that day.
Sum or average the daily HDDs over your forecast horizon (e.g., 7 days).
Aggregate / Weight by Population

Multiply each city‚Äôs HDD by pop_weight.
Sum across all cities to get a Weighted HDD value for the entire ‚Äúregion‚Äù you‚Äôre tracking.
Compare to Historical Averages

You need to know the normal or 5-year average HDD for each day/period.
EIA or NOAA can provide climate normals (or you can store your own historical data).
Calculate the deviation: (Current Weighted HDD) - (Historical Weighted HDD).
A positive deviation (colder-than-normal) signals potentially stronger demand.
Incorporate Storage & Pipeline Data

Weekly Storage: Pull from EIA‚Äôs API to see if overall storage is trending below or above the 5-year average.
Pipeline Flows: If possible, scrape a major pipeline‚Äôs postings to see if constraints or high flows are forecasted.
Generate a ‚ÄúDemand‚Äù or ‚ÄúBullishness‚Äù Score

For example, a naive formula:
Score
=
(
Weighted¬†HDD¬†Deviation
)
‚ÄÖ‚Ää
+
‚ÄÖ‚Ää
(
Storage¬†Deficit¬†Factor
)
‚ÄÖ‚Ää
‚àí
‚ÄÖ‚Ää
(
Pipeline¬†Flow¬†Surplus¬†Factor
)
Score=(Weighted¬†HDD¬†Deviation)+(Storage¬†Deficit¬†Factor)‚àí(Pipeline¬†Flow¬†Surplus¬†Factor)
The software engineer can code any weighting scheme you want (e.g., 50% weighting to HDD, 30% to storage, 20% to pipeline flows).
Decision Logic

If Score > 0, you might interpret that as ‚ÄúColder + Tighter Supply => Buy natural gas futures.‚Äù
If Score < 0, interpret as ‚ÄúMilder + Adequate Supply => Sell or reduce long positions.‚Äù
If near 0, you might ‚ÄúHold‚Äù or remain neutral.
Schedule Regular Updates

Weather forecasts update multiple times per day (e.g., 00z, 06z, 12z, 18z for NOAA).
EIA storage data updates weekly.
You might run your model once daily (morning) to see how the forecast changed from the previous run.
4. Example Python Code (Extended)
Below is a single integrated Python script you can show your engineer. It:

Pulls OpenWeatherMap forecasts for multiple cities.
Computes and aggregates HDD.
Pulls EIA weekly storage data.
(Optionally) demonstrates how you might scrape a pipeline site.
Produces a score as a naive example.
python
Copy
import requests
import datetime
import statistics
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # Only needed if you plan to scrape pipeline sites.

# List of major winter-prone cities or zip codes

    {"name": "Philadelphia", "zip": "19103", "pop_weight": 0.05},
    # Add more as needed...
]

# For demonstration, let's define a "normal" Weighted HDD for a given day:
# In a real solution, you'd pull historical data from NOAA/EIA to create daily norms.
NORMAL_HDD = 15.0  # A placeholder. In reality, you'd vary this by time of year.

# Suppose 2000 Bcf is the "normal" storage level for this time of year.

Explanation of the Main Steps
Get OWM Forecast: The function fetches the next ~24 hours of 3-hour increments, averages them, then computes HDD.
Weight by Population: Summation of each city‚Äôs HDD * population weight.
EIA Storage Data: We call get_eia_storage for the ‚ÄúLower 48 working gas‚Äù series, parse the JSON, and extract the latest Bcf reading.
Optional Pipeline Scraping: Illustrative only‚Äîevery pipeline is unique.
Score Calculation:
score += hdd_deviation (colder than normal ‚Üí higher score).
score += storage_diff / 100 (lower storage ‚Üí bullish).
score -= flow_diff / 100 (higher pipeline flow ‚Üí more supply ‚Üí offsets bullishness).
5. Implementation Notes & Disclaimers
Data Granularity:

EIA storage is weekly (not real-time).
Weather is updated multiple times daily.
Pipeline scraping might be daily or intraday.
The final model can only be as real-time as its slowest data feed.
Historical Normal / Seasonal Deviations:

The above code uses placeholders (NORMAL_HDD, NORMAL_STORAGE).
In production, you‚Äôd store or retrieve actual historical data (e.g., 5-year averages) for each day of the year.
Pipeline Scraping Complexity:

Each pipeline operator site may require different scraping logic or even partial authentication.
Some pipeline bulletins are PDF-based or behind paywalls, requiring more advanced parsing.
Trading & Risk Management:

This example code is purely educational. Actual trading strategies typically involve risk controls, additional fundamental data (production rates, LNG exports, etc.), and advanced forecasting models.
6. Final Hand-Off to Your Engineer
In short: Provide your engineer with:

The list of target cities (zip codes & population weights).
API keys (OpenWeatherMap, EIA).
Desired pipeline scraping targets (if applicable).
Preferred schedule (e.g., run once every morning to align with new weather model runs, or more often).
A plan for storing historical data if you want more precise normal/average comparisons.
They can then adapt the example Python above (or convert it to another language) and refine the scoring methodology to fit your exact use case.

Final Summary for Your Engineer
Primary Goal: Aggregate weather data (HDD) from major population centers to estimate winter heating demand ‚Üí correlate with nat gas price movements.
Core Steps:
Weather: Pull daily average temps from a free/freemium API ‚Üí compute HDD ‚Üí aggregate/weight by population.
Storage: Fetch weekly gas storage data (EIA).
Pipeline: Optionally scrape capacity/flow info from pipeline bulletins.
Compare to historical norms ‚Üí create a ‚Äúdemand score‚Äù or ‚Äúsignal.‚Äù
Implementation: The included Python snippet demonstrates how these data might be fetched, processed, and combined into a simple bullish/bearish trade signal.
Caveat: Real trading desks use more sophisticated, real-time data and advanced models. But the methodology here is a solid starting framework for any weather-driven nat gas demand analysis.
