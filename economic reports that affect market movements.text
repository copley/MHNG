For Natural Gas, the most relevant weekly economic report is:

EIA Natural Gas Storage Report
ðŸ“… Release Time:

Every Thursday at 10:30 AM ET
If a US holiday falls on a Thursday, the report is delayed by one day.
ðŸ“ˆ Impact on Natural Gas Futures (NG)

Yes, it is a high-impact report. The report provides data on working gas in underground storage, and traders use it to gauge supply/demand balance.
Key market-moving reactions:
Larger-than-expected build (more supply) â†’ Bearish (natural gas prices drop)
Larger-than-expected draw (higher demand/lower supply) â†’ Bullish (natural gas prices rise)
Does it always move the market?
Most of the time, yes. If the actual storage change deviates significantly from expectations, you will see an immediate price reaction in Natural Gas futures (NG).
However, if the report aligns with expectations, the market reaction may be muted.
Other Reports Mentioned & Their Relevance to Natural Gas
EIA Petroleum Status Report (Wednesdays, 10:30 AM ET)

Not directly relevant to Natural Gas. It primarily affects Crude Oil (WTI & Brent).
However, if oil inventories rise or fall sharply, there can be some correlation between oil and natural gas prices due to energy demand shifts.
API Weekly Statistical Bulletin (Tuesdays, 4:30 PM ET)

Not a primary driver of Natural Gas.
Mostly impacts Crude Oil prices ahead of the EIA Petroleum Status Report.
USDA Export Sales Report (Thursdays, 8:30 AM ET)

No direct impact on Natural Gas.
This report mainly affects agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soybeans).
Initial Jobless Claims (Thursdays, 8:30 AM ET)

Minimal short-term impact on Natural Gas.
Can influence overall market sentiment but does not directly move NG futures unless it significantly affects macroeconomic conditions.
Commitments of Traders (COT) Report (Fridays, 3:30 PM ET)

Useful for long-term positioning but not for short-term trades.
It shows institutional positioning in Natural Gas futures, helping traders gauge sentiment.
Final Verdict:
For Natural Gas, the EIA Natural Gas Storage Report (Thursdays, 10:30 AM ET) is the most accurate, reliable, and consistently market-moving report. The others primarily impact crude oil, stocks, and agricultural commodities rather than natural gas.

Here are the details on the release times and historical market impact for the three fundamental reports:

1. Crude Oil (WTI or Brent) - EIA Crude Oil Inventory Report
ðŸ“… Release Time:

Every Wednesday at 10:30 AM ET (Eastern Time)
If a US holiday falls on a Monday, the release shifts to Thursday at 11:00 AM ET
ðŸ“ˆ Does it always move the market?

Yes, it often does. The market reacts strongly if the report shows a significant build or draw in oil inventories.
Biggest moves happen when:
A larger-than-expected build â†’ Bearish (oil prices drop)
A larger-than-expected draw â†’ Bullish (oil prices rise)
Factors that weaken its impact:
If the report aligns closely with analyst expectations
If OPEC or geopolitical news overshadows the inventory data
2. S&P 500 E-Mini - US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) Report
ðŸ“… Release Time:

First Friday of each month at 8:30 AM ET
ðŸ“ˆ Does it always move the market?

Most of the time, yes. The NFP report is one of the biggest market-moving events of the month for stock indices.
Biggest moves happen when:
Stronger-than-expected job growth â†’ Bullish (stocks rally, risk-on sentiment)
Weaker-than-expected job growth â†’ Bearish (stocks drop, risk-off sentiment)
Higher-than-expected wage inflation â†’ Bearish (triggers Fed tightening fears)
Factors that weaken its impact:
If the Federal Reserve has already set clear policy expectations
If there is another major event (e.g., geopolitical tensions, earnings season)
3. Gold (XAU/USD or Gold Futures) - Federal Reserve Interest Rate Decision
ðŸ“… Release Time:

8 times per year, on a Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET
Followed by the FOMC Press Conference at 2:30 PM ET
ðŸ“ˆ Does it always move the market?

Yes, but the size of the move depends on surprises.
Biggest moves happen when:
Rate hikes (Hawkish stance) â†’ Bearish for gold (gold falls due to higher yields)
Rate cuts (Dovish stance) â†’ Bullish for gold (gold rises as USD weakens)
Unexpected rate decisions create extreme volatility
Factors that weaken its impact:
If the rate decision was fully expected and already priced in
If inflation data or Fed comments provide mixed signals
Summary: The Most Reliable Movers
NFP (S&P 500 E-Mini) â†’ Almost always moves markets strongly
EIA Crude Inventory (Oil) â†’ High impact but can be overshadowed by OPEC/geopolitics
Fed Rate Decision (Gold) â†’ High impact but depends on market expectations
If you are looking for the easiest, most predictable trade, NFP and Fed Rate Decisions historically offer the strongest and most consistent reactions. Crude Oil Inventories can also be lucrative but are more susceptible to external factors.
