Natural Gas Basics
Composition and Quality of Natural Gas
Natural gas is primarily composed of methane (CH₄) with smaller quantities of other hydrocarbons and impurities. Typical raw natural gas can contain 60–90% methane, up to 20% ethane (C₂H₆), up to 20% propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀), and small percentages of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N₂), hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), and trace gases​
CROFTSYSTEMS.NET
. After processing, pipeline-quality natural gas delivered to consumers is almost pure methane (generally >90–95% CH₄)​
CROFTSYSTEMS.NET
. Gas with a high content of heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, etc.) is termed “rich” or “wet” gas, whereas mostly-methane gas is “lean” or “dry.” Heavier components must be removed to meet pipeline quality standards and to prevent condensation or corrosion issues. Impurities like H₂S (sour gas) and CO₂ are also removed to ensure a clean, safe fuel​
GROUP.MET.COM
. The quality of natural gas is often measured by its energy content (heating value); richer gas (with more ethane/propane) has a higher heating value, but pipelines usually require gas to fall within a certain BTU range for safety and appliance compatibility​

Measurement and Heating Value
Natural gas volumes are commonly measured in cubic feet (ft³) or cubic meters, but commerce is often based on energy content (British Thermal Units, or BTUs). One cubic foot of typical dry natural gas contains about 1,000 BTU of energy (the U.S. average heat content in 2023 was ~1,038 BTU per cubic foot)​
EIA.GOV
. For larger quantities, units like MMBtu (million BTUs) or therms are used (1 therm = 100,000 BTU)​
EIA.GOV
. Pipeline companies and utilities track gas in MMBtu or therms to account for energy content differences. Gas heating value and Wobbe index are important quality metrics – they must stay within limits so that burners and engines operate efficiently. Contracts often specify a acceptable BTU range (e.g. ~950–1100 BTU/cf) for delivered gas​
EIA.GOV
​
EIA.GOV
. Meters (like orifice or ultrasonic flowmeters) measure volume at standard conditions, and gas chromatographs determine composition to calculate the exact heating value for custody transfer. In billing, customers ultimately pay for the energy (e.g. per MMBtu), not just volume​

Exploration and Production (Upstream)
Exploration for natural gas begins with geological surveys and seismic studies to identify potential subsurface gas traps. Companies acquire mineral leases, then drill exploration wells to find gas. If successful, wells are completed to produce the gas. Natural gas is found in two main forms: conventional reservoirs (large porous rock formations where gas has accumulated in traps) and unconventional reservoirs like shale and tight sandstone, where gas is in low-permeability rock and often requires hydraulic fracturing to produce​
EIA.GOV
. Some gas is also associated with oil – produced from oil wells along with crude (this associated gas can be dissolved in oil or as a free gas cap)​
EIA.GOV
. In contrast, non-associated gas comes from gas-only fields. Over the past few decades, technological advances (horizontal drilling and fracking) unlocked vast shale gas resources, greatly increasing production. Once a well is drilled and completed, production involves bringing the gas to the surface, separating any oil or water, and handling the raw gas. At the wellhead, initial separation removes liquids (condensate and water). The raw gas (often called wet gas if it contains NGLs and impurities) then enters the gathering system. In production operations, maintaining well pressure and flow is crucial; sometimes compression is added at the well if reservoir pressure declines. Producers monitor reserve levels and decline rates to plan drilling of new wells to sustain output. Overall, the upstream process results in raw natural gas that must be transported and processed before it is market-ready.
Midstream: Pipeline Operations and Storage
After production, the midstream sector takes over, moving natural gas from the wellhead to end users. This starts with gathering systems – networks of small-diameter, low-pressure pipelines that collect gas from multiple wells and carry it to processing plants or trunk pipelines​
EIA.GOV
. Field compressor stations boost the gas pressure as needed to move it through the gathering lines. Next, gas may pass through a processing plant (see next section) to remove NGLs and impurities. The treated dry gas enters transmission pipelines: wide-diameter, high-pressure pipelines that transport gas over long distances across regions​
EIA.GOV
. These interstate (and intrastate) pipelines form a highly integrated grid. In the United States, for example, the gas pipeline network spans ~3 million miles, delivering ~29 trillion cubic feet of gas annually to millions of consumers​
EIA.GOV
. Along transmission lines, compressor stations (placed every 50–100 miles or so) keep the gas pressurized and moving forward. Pipeline operators maintain control centers with SCADA systems to monitor flows, pressures, and conditions across the network in real time​
ENBRIDGE.COM
. They can remotely adjust compressors and valves to optimize the flow and ensure safety. Safety is paramount: pipelines are equipped with automatic shut-off valves and pressure relief systems, and operators follow strict integrity management programs (regular inspections, corrosion control, leak detection, etc.). Storage is a key part of pipeline operations as well. During periods of low demand (e.g. summer), excess gas is injected into underground storage facilities (depleted gas reservoirs, aquifers, or salt caverns). Later, in high-demand periods (winter cold snaps), this gas is withdrawn to supplement production. This storage system buffers seasonal demand swings and adds reliability. For instance, many utilities fill storage in summer to ensure adequate winter supply. The midstream network, from wellhead to citygate, is often described as going from “wellhead to burner-tip,” emphasizing the continuous journey of gas through gathering, processing, transmission, distribution, and finally to the end-user’s appliance.
Pipeline Economics and Capacity
Moving gas involves economic arrangements and capacity rights. Pipeline companies typically charge tariffs for transportation service. Two main types of service are offered: firm transportation and interruptible transportation. Firm service guarantees the shipper a reserved capacity on the pipeline that will be delivered without interruption except in extreme force majeure events​
INGAA.ORG
. Customers pay for this guaranteed capacity (often through demand charges) whether or not they use it, ensuring pipelines recover fixed costs. Interruptible service is lower-priority and lower-cost – the shipper can ship gas when there is available capacity, but service can be cut or curtailed if the pipeline is full with firm shipments​
INGAA.ORG
. Interruptible rates are cheaper, reflecting the higher risk of interruption​
INGAA.ORG
. Pipeline economics also involve distance (longer hauls may incur higher cost) and usage factors. Pipelines are capital-intensive, so operators rely on long-term contracts with shippers (producers, marketers, utilities) to underwrite new capacity. An interstate pipeline’s rates and terms are regulated by authorities (e.g. FERC in the U.S.) and documented in a published tariff​
INGAA.ORG
. Natural gas hubs have emerged at pipeline interconnections – locations like the Henry Hub in Louisiana (a junction of many pipelines) act as market centers where gas from various sources commingles and is traded. Efficient pipeline economics enable gas from producing regions to reach consuming markets at least cost. Additionally, pipelines offer services like park-and-loan (temporary storage on the pipeline), backhaul/forwardhaul arrangements, and storage services to provide flexibility. The concept of basis refers to price differences between locations, often reflecting transportation costs and constraints; when basis is wide, it may signal pipeline bottlenecks or high demand in one region. For example, if Northeast citygate prices spike in winter well above Henry Hub, it indicates pipeline capacity into the region is tight relative to demand. Overall, pipeline economics balance the needs for reliable delivery (firm contracts, expansion projects) with efficient utilization (selling interruptible capacity when unused and using storage to balance loads).
Gas Marketing and Pricing
Once natural gas is processed and in the pipeline system, it becomes a commodity sold in wholesale markets. Gas marketing involves producers, marketing companies, pipeline marketers, utilities, and large consumers arranging purchases and sales of gas. Prices are primarily determined by supply and demand fundamentals – production levels, weather-driven demand (cold winters or hot summers boosting heating or power generation needs), storage inventories, and competition from other fuels. Natural gas prices are quoted at various hubs and market locations. The most famous benchmark is the Henry Hub price in Louisiana, which serves as the pricing basis for the NYMEX natural gas futures contract​
SPRINGERPROFESSIONAL.DE
. There are also many regional price points (e.g. Alberta AECO, Permian Waha, Chicago Citygate, UK’s NBP, etc.), and the differences between them (basis) reflect transportation differentials or regional imbalances. Wholesale gas can be transacted in spot markets (for day-ahead or intraday delivery) or via term contracts (months or years). Many large consumers and utilities buy a portion of gas on long-term contracts (with pricing formulas or indices), and the rest on spot or monthly index prices to balance flexibility and certainty. Published price indices (e.g. Gas Daily or Inside FERC indexes) are widely used, representing average trades at a location over a time period (daily or monthly). Gas pricing strategies may include fixed-price agreements, index-linked deals (where price is set as an index plus/minus a basis differential), or participation in auctions at hub trading platforms. Because gas demand and prices can be volatile, many industry participants use hedging strategies. On the financial side, the natural gas futures contract (Henry Hub) has been traded since April 1990 and is a primary hedging tool for the market​
SPRINGERPROFESSIONAL.DE
. A producer might sell futures to lock in a forward price for their output, while a power plant or utility might buy futures or options to secure a stable fuel cost. In addition to futures, swaps and options on gas (and increasingly on regional basis) allow risk management. For physical hedging, storage is also used – buying gas in low-demand periods to store and later use or sell during high-demand periods effectively locks in a spread. Hedging helps smooth out price fluctuations: for example, a local distribution company (LDC) might hedge a portion of winter gas needs in summer to avoid price spikes affecting customers, or an industrial user might sign a fixed-price contract for a year with a marketer who then hedges in the futures market.
Gas Contract Strategies and Types
In deregulated markets, natural gas is bought and sold via contracts between producers, marketers, pipelines, and end-users. Different contract strategies are employed to meet the needs of buyers and sellers. A common contract is a supply contract between a producer (or marketer) and a buyer (utility or large user) for a term (e.g. one year or more) with specified daily volumes. These can be firm supply (with penalties if the seller fails to deliver or buyer fails to take) or interruptible. Contract pricing may be fixed, but more often is indexed to market prices (for instance, “Henry Hub monthly index + $0.10” or a basket of indices) to allow flexibility with market movements. Some contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses (obligating the buyer to pay for a minimum volume even if not taken, ensuring the seller a minimum revenue) – these were common historically, though less so after deregulation rebalanced risks. On the pipeline side, shippers secure transportation contracts (as discussed, firm or interruptible). A marketing strategy for a producer might involve portfolio optimization: selling some gas at fixed prices (hedged) to ensure a baseline revenue, some at floating market prices to allow upside, and possibly storing gas when prices are low to sell later at higher prices. From the buyer’s perspective, strategies include diversifying supply sources and pricing mechanisms – e.g. an electric utility might contract for a base load of gas at fixed price, additional volumes at index, and hold options to buy extra gas in winter if needed. Gas marketing companies often act as intermediaries, buying from many producers and selling to many consumers, managing the logistics and price risk in between (for a margin). Real-world application: A notable example of gas contract strategy is how utilities responded to the extreme price volatility during a severe cold wave. In one case, a sudden winter price spike (spot gas surged to unprecedented levels) caused financial strain. After such events, buyers and sellers have revisited contract terms to include price ceilings or alternative pricing for emergency situations​
OGJ.COM
. Some gas processors with contracts tied to gas and NGL prices suffered huge losses when gas spiked and NGL prices fell (making processing uneconomic). In response, they negotiated contract modifications with producers to temporarily suspend certain provisions (like “keep-whole” obligations, explained below)​
OGJ.COM
. These strategies underscore that gas contracts must balance risk between parties and sometimes include clauses to handle extreme market conditions.
Real-World Insight: Case Study
One historical case study illustrating many of the above concepts is the U.S. natural gas market restructuring of the 1980s–1990s. Prior to the 1980s, natural gas prices were regulated and pipelines often bought gas from producers and resold to utilities (the pipeline acting as merchant). This led to inefficiencies and supply shortages in the 1970s. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 began partial wellhead price deregulation​
DIVERSEGY.COM
. The major breakthrough came with FERC Order 636 in 1992, which mandated the unbundling of transportation and sales – pipelines could no longer charge bundled rates for gas and transport, and had to offer open-access transportation to any qualified shipper​
DIVERSEGY.COM
. After this deregulation, an open marketplace for gas emerged. Producers sold directly to marketers or end-users, and pipelines carried gas for a posted tariff. This gave rise to the “gas marketing” industry and market hubs with transparent pricing. The NYMEX futures contract, initiated in 1990, provided a benchmark and hedging mechanism​
SPRINGERPROFESSIONAL.DE
. As a result, the U.S. gas industry moved from long-term fixed-priced contracts and take-or-pay obligations (which had led to problems like the mid-1980s take-or-pay contract crisis) to a more flexible system of short-term and medium-term contracts indexed to market prices, backed by financial hedges for risk management. Consumers benefited from more competitive gas prices, and producers gained a more direct link to market demand (though with more price volatility exposure). This case demonstrates how regulatory changes and contract strategies evolved hand-in-hand: when regulations forced open access, the industry shifted to new contract forms and pricing methods that better allocate risk and reward in a competitive market.

The Natural Gas Grid and Gas Composition
The natural gas grid refers to the entire network of infrastructure transporting gas from production areas to end users. It includes gathering pipelines, processing plants, transmission pipelines, storage sites, and local distribution networks. This grid is highly developed in major producing regions like North America and Europe. For example, the U.S. pipeline grid consists of hundreds of thousands of miles of interstate and intrastate pipelines interconnecting production basins, market hubs, underground storage, and distribution companies​
EIA.GOV
. Gas entering the grid must meet strict composition and quality specifications. Raw produced gas often contains heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, etc.) and contaminants as noted earlier. Before entering large transmission lines, gas is treated such that it is predominantly methane with only small fractions of CO₂, N₂, or other diluents. Rich gas vs. lean gas is a key concept: rich (high-BTU) gas from fields with lots of NGL content must be processed to a leaner state. Pipeline tariffs usually specify maximum allowable levels of CO₂, H₂S (for safety and corrosion prevention), water (to avoid hydrate formation), and a narrow range of heating value​
EIA.GOV
​
EIA.GOV
. In practice, midstream companies will blend or process gas streams so that the composite gas meets a uniform standard. For instance, gas coming out of a processing plant in Texas might have a gross heating value ~1010 BTU/scf to comply with pipeline standards​
EIA.GOV
​
EIA.GOV
. The overall gas grid functions like an “energy highway,” and maintaining consistent gas quality is crucial for interchangeability—so that any consumer along the network receives gas suitable for their equipment.
Gas Gathering Systems
Gas gathering is the first midstream step, funneling gas from multiple wells to a central point. Gathering systems are typically made of small-diameter pipelines (4 to 12 inches) that snake through producing areas, connecting individual wellheads to processing facilities or larger trunk pipelines. These lines often operate at lower pressures than main transmission lines. Because they run over often extensive areas and various properties, obtaining rights-of-way and access agreements from landowners is a key part of gathering system development. In the field, one can see networks of flowlines from well pads feeding into larger gathering headers. As gas flows from the well, the pressure declines over distance and as it goes through separators, so field compressors are commonly installed in gathering systems. These compressors (usually gas-fired reciprocating engines) boost the gas pressure to keep it moving and to overcome the back-pressure of downstream equipment. Gathering systems must handle gas that can be quite “raw” – it may still contain significant liquids and contaminants. Therefore, design considerations include slope (to allow liquids to drain or be collected), materials resistant to any corrosive components, and sometimes pigging facilities to clean the lines. Modern gathering networks also include instrumentation and control to manage flows from dozens or hundreds of wells. Commercially, producers dedicate the output of their wells to a gathering system often via a Gathering Agreement which specifies a gathering fee (per MMBtu or Mcf) and quality requirements at the entry to the gathering line. In summary, gathering systems are the capillaries of the gas industry, moving gas from scattered sources into the larger arteries of the transmission network.
Compression and Treating
Throughout the midstream chain, compression is critical to move gas. Gas expands and loses pressure as it travels; compressors add energy back into the gas by increasing its pressure. In field gathering, low-pressure gas from wells might be only a few tens of psi; compressors step it up to a few hundred psi for input to processing plants or pipelines. Later, large pipeline compressor stations (with powerful turbine-driven centrifugal compressors or large reciprocating units) raise pressures to 800–1500 psi for long-distance pipelines. Compressors are typically housed in stations that also have coolers (as compressing gas heats it up) and scrubbers to remove any entrained liquids. They are monitored closely for mechanical integrity and are often remotely controlled via SCADA. Gas treating refers to removing impurities from the gas stream to meet quality specs or protect downstream equipment. The primary treating steps are: acid gas removal (eliminating H₂S and CO₂) and dehydration (removing water vapor). In many production areas, raw gas contains CO₂ or H₂S (sour gas) that must be scrubbed out. This is commonly done using amine treating units, where the gas is bubbled through an amine solution that absorbs CO₂/H₂S, which is then regenerated and cycled (the Claus process may be used to convert removed H₂S into elemental sulfur in large plants). The treated gas exiting an amine unit has only trace CO₂/H₂S (e.g. <2–4% CO₂ and <0.25 grain H₂S per 100 scf, depending on pipeline specs). Dehydration is usually done by glycol contactors – the gas is contacted with triethylene glycol (TEG) which absorbs water, then the glycol is regenerated by heating to boil off the water​
CROFTSYSTEMS.NET
. This ensures the gas has a very low dewpoint (no water condenses in pipelines). In some cases, other treating steps include nitrogen rejection (for high-N₂ gas), mercury removal (for LNG feed gas), or filtering out solids. By removing contaminants, treating protects pipelines from corrosion/hydrates and ensures the gas burns cleanly. The combination of compression and treating readies the gas for the next major step: processing for NGL extraction.
Gas Processing and NGL Recovery
Gas processing plants are facilities that remove natural gas liquids (NGLs) and any remaining impurities from the gas, resulting in pipeline-quality dry gas and a stream of NGLs as valuable by-products. In many cases, gas coming straight from the field (especially if it’s rich gas) cannot go directly into major pipelines because its BTU content is too high or it contains too much liquefiable hydrocarbons. Processing plants use a series of cryogenic and distillation steps to extract these components. Modern plants often employ a cryogenic expansion process that chills the gas to very low temperatures (e.g. -150°F) causing ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes to condense out. The typical efficiency of NGL recovery is high: a good plant might recover >90% of ethane and nearly 100% of propane+ from the inlet gas under ethane-recovery mode. The remaining methane (now “dry gas”) is recompressed and sent into transmission pipelines. This dry gas, often ~98% methane, meets pipeline specifications for heating value and stability​
EIA.GOV
​
EIA.GOV
. The separated NGLs come off as a mixture often called “Y-grade” or NGL mix. This mix will be further processed in fractionation facilities (discussed below). Gas processing capacity has grown alongside production – as of 2017 there were about 510 active gas processing plants in the U.S. Lower-48, with total capacity around 80.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d)​
SAFETY4SEA.COM
. These plants on average processed ~53 Bcf/d (about 66% utilization, with spare capacity for growth)​
SAFETY4SEA.COM
. Major gas-producing regions like Texas, Appalachia (Pennsylvania/West Virginia), and North Dakota have seen significant increases in processing capacity to handle shale gas output​
SAFETY4SEA.COM
. Operationally, processing plants also produce plant fuel (using some gas for their own fuel needs) and flare small amounts for safety. The economics of gas processing depend on the value of extracted NGLs versus the value lost in the gas (called the shrinkage). For example, ethane may be left in the gas (called ethane rejection) if ethane prices are very low, to avoid losing heating value. When NGL prices are favorable, processors recover as much as possible. In Texas’s Permian Basin, very NGL-rich gas is processed heavily – one benefit is that by pulling out more NGLs (especially ethane), the pipeline throughput of methane can increase, easing constraints when pipelines are near capacity​
EIA.GOV
 (since removing liquids reduces volume and frees up pipeline space for methane). Thus, gas processing not only yields valuable liquids but also plays a role in managing gas quality and pipeline logistics. From a real-world standpoint, gas processing has enabled the development of petrochemical industries (by providing ethane/propane feedstocks) and reduced flaring. In areas like North Dakota, new gas plants built during the shale boom significantly reduced flaring of associated gas by capturing and processing it into marketable products. Midstream companies constantly balance how much to invest in processing: under-building leads to flaring and lost NGL value; over-building can leave plants underutilized if production falls. The trend is toward larger, more efficient cryogenic plants able to switch between ethane recovery and rejection depending on market signals.
Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) and Fractionation
Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) refer to the hydrocarbon liquids extracted from natural gas streams, which include ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈), normal butane (n-C₄H₁₀), isobutane (i-C₄H₁₀), and natural gasoline (pentanes+). These are sometimes collectively called Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPGs) (a term often focusing on propane and butane)​
CMEGROUP.COM
. NGLs have a variety of uses: ethane is mainly used as a petrochemical feedstock (cracked to produce ethylene for plastics), propane is used for heating, cooking, and as a petrochemical feedstock, butanes are used in gasoline blending (octane enhancement) and as refrigerants, and natural gasoline (pentane+) is used as a blendstock or diluent for heavy oil​
CROFTSYSTEMS.NET
. After NGLs are recovered in a gas processing plant as an unfractionated mix, they must be separated into individual products – this is done in an NGL fractionation facility. Fractionation is essentially a distillation process: the NGL mix is boiled and condensed in a series of towers (deethanizer, depropanizer, debutanizer, etc.), each one separating a lighter fraction from a heavier one. For example, a deethanizer tower will boil off ethane (which goes overhead and is collected as purity ethane product) while leaving heavier NGLs as bottoms. Then a depropanizer separates propane from butanes, and so on. The result is “purity products”: ethane ~99% pure, propane ~95+% pure, etc., ready for sale. Major fractionation hubs have developed where large NGL volumes are available. In the U.S., Mont Belvieu, Texas is the primary NGL hub – it has massive fractionation capacity and extensive salt-cavern storage for NGLs. Mont Belvieu (along with Conway, Kansas) is one of two key trading and storage hubs for NGLs in the U.S.​
CMEGROUP.COM
. With its proximity to Gulf Coast petrochemical markets and export facilities, Mont Belvieu has become the price reference point for NGL markets in North America. In fact, most NGL pricing indexes (OPIS, etc.) are based on Mont Belvieu spot prices. Conway, KS is another hub serving Midcontinent producers and linking to Midwestern markets, though Mont Belvieu dominates in volume. Other regions, like Alberta in Canada or the North Sea in Europe, have their own fractionation and NGL center points as well (e.g. Sarnia, Ontario or the Mongstad complex in Norway). NGL transportation can be via pipelines (there are dedicated NGL pipelines moving mixed NGLs to fractionators and moving purity products to consumers), via rail (pressurized rail cars for propane, butane, etc.), trucks (for shorter distances or smaller volumes), and via ship. Propane and butane (LPG) in particular are exported by sea from hubs like Houston/Mont Belvieu in large refrigerated tankers. Because NGLs are valuable, midstream companies invest in fractionators to maximize the product worth. For example, Enterprise Products Partners and other midstream firms have built new fractionation trains at Mont Belvieu in recent years to accommodate the flood of NGLs from shale gas processing​
CMEGROUP.COM
. Market pricing for NGLs is largely supply-and-demand driven for each product. Ethane’s price, for instance, is tied to the ethylene market; in recent years U.S. ethane had periods of oversupply where its price was so low that it was often left in gas (rejected) rather than recovered. However, with new petrochemical plants and export demand, ethane prices have strengthened. In fact, between 2019 and 2023, the premium of ethane over natural gas has risen (ethane becoming more valuable relative to its BTU-equivalent gas value), leading processors to recover more ethane wherever possible​
EIA.GOV
. Propane and butane prices often correlate with crude oil prices (since they compete in heating and are linked to gasoline blending and petrochem markets), but can spike seasonally (propane often rises in winter due to heating demand). Pricing strategies for NGLs include term contracts with petrochemical consumers or propane distributors, often indexed to Mont Belvieu prices, as well as spot sales. Some producers might pre-sell NGLs via contract to ensure stable cash flow, while others take their chances on the spot market. In summary, NGLs are a significant revenue stream for midstream companies and producers of wet gas. Efficient fractionation and access to market (storage and transport) are crucial for monetizing these liquids. The midstream sector has to be adept at switching modes: when NGL prices justify, recover everything (ethane recovery mode); when not, leave the ethane (ethane rejection mode) and just take propane+ to maximize overall value. This dynamic operation is a best practice to capture the highest overall value from the gas stream under changing market conditions​

Processing Agreements and Commercial Terms
Midstream companies and producers formalize their relationships via processing agreements. These contracts govern how gas is processed and how the economic value is split between the producer (who owns the raw gas) and the processor (who operates the plant). Several common contract models exist in the industry:
Fee-Based Processing: The processor charges a fixed fee (e.g. per Mcf or MMBtu of gas) for processing services, and the producer retains ownership of all NGLs extracted​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
. In this model, the processor has no direct commodity exposure – they get paid the fee regardless of NGL prices. The producer gets 100% of the NGLs (and can sell them) but must pay the fee even if NGL prices are low. This is a low-risk deal for processors, with predictable revenue, while producers gain all upside (and downside) on NGL value. Fee-based deals are common when producers want to keep their NGLs or when processing economics are uncertain. Consideration: a fixed fee limits the processor’s upside potential​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
, so fees are set based on expected costs plus a margin.
Keep-Whole Agreement: In a keep-whole contract, the processor extracts NGLs from the gas and “keeps whole” the producer on a BTU basis by returning an equivalent amount of methane-rich gas (residue) to the producer​
CASELAW.FINDLAW.COM
. Effectively, the processor gets to keep all the NGLs as compensation. For example, for 100 MMBtu of inlet gas, if the NGLs removed account for 10 MMBtu, the processor will return 90 MMBtu of residue gas to the producer (which has the same energy as the original gas minus NGLs). The producer can then sell that residue gas, and the processor sells the NGLs. In keep-whole, the processor’s profit comes from the value of NGLs minus the value of the shrinkage gas. If NGL prices are high relative to gas, the processor does well; if NGL prices crash or gas prices spike, the processor could even be in the red (since they must effectively buy gas to return to the producer). Thus, keep-whole exposes the processor to commodity risk on both gas and liquids​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
​
OGJ.COM
. Sometimes keep-whole contracts also include a processing fee or fuel reimbursement. Historically, many contracts were keep-whole when gas was cheap and NGLs were a premium; but during periods like winter 2000/01, when gas prices soared above NGL value, keep-whole processors lost money​
OGJ.COM
​
OGJ.COM
. This has led to fewer pure keep-whole deals unless mitigated by hedging or special clauses.
Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) Agreement: In a POP contract, the processor and producer share the revenues from the sale of extracted NGLs (and sometimes residue gas) in a predetermined split​
CASELAW.FINDLAW.COM
​
CASELAW.FINDLAW.COM
. For instance, a POP deal might give the processor 20% of the gross NGL sales proceeds (or volumes – see POL below) and the producer 80%. The processor’s share serves as the processing payment. In some POP contracts, the processor may also deduct a fuel or shrinkage factor. A variant is Percent-of-Liquids (POL) where instead of sharing the cash, the processor takes a portion of the actual liquids produced (in-kind) and sells them independently​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
. POP/POL contracts align interests to some degree: both parties benefit when NGL prices are higher. However, the processor still has commodity exposure on their portion (they gain if liquids prices rise, but if prices are low their revenue drops)​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
. POP contracts became very popular as an alternative to keep-whole because they share risk: the producer doesn’t bear all risk of low NGL prices (as in fee-based) and the processor doesn’t either (as in keep-whole). For example, in shale plays many gathering & processing agreements with midstream Master Limited Partnerships were structured as POP, giving processors a direct stake in commodity prices (often partially hedged by the MLP). One consideration: POP contracts typically expose the processor 100% to commodity risk on their share, so some contracts include floors or sub-clauses to protect the processor in extreme conditions​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
. Also, sometimes POP contracts have fixed recovery assumptions (processor is paid based on an agreed recovery level, not actual, to incentivize efficiency).
Hybrid and Other Structures: Variations and combinations exist. Fee + POP hybrid might charge a small fee plus a smaller percentage of proceeds – giving the processor some guaranteed revenue plus upside. Another is “floor-with-escalator” where a minimum fee applies, but if NGL prices exceed a threshold, the processor gets a share. Fixed-ethane vs full-recovery deals: sometimes contracts treat ethane differently (since ethane’s value can swing widely). For example, a contract could be POP on propane+ and fee-based on ethane or give the producer the option to reject ethane without penalty. There are also wellhead purchase agreements, where a midstream company simply buys the raw gas at the wellhead from the producer at a specified price (taking title) and then processes and sells the outputs for itself​
CASELAW.FINDLAW.COM
. In that case, from the producer’s perspective it’s a sale, not a service agreement.
Each style has its pros and cons and is chosen based on the parties’ risk tolerance and market outlook. In recent years, many producers prefer fee-based or POP structures to avoid the volatile results of keep-whole under high gas price scenarios, whereas processors might accept some POP to stay competitive in winning business but often hedge the commodity exposure.
Key Terms and Conditions in Midstream Contracts
Processing and midstream contracts contain a variety of technical and commercial terms to define responsibilities and ensure smooth operations. Some key terms include:
Volume and Commitment: Agreements may include minimum volume commitments (MVCs) from the producer – e.g. the producer commits to deliver a certain volume or pay a shortfall fee. This ensures the processor’s facilities are utilized. There might also be reserve dedication clauses (the producer dedicates all gas from a certain acreage or field to this processor for the contract duration).
Delivery Point and Pressure: The contract will specify where the producer delivers gas to the processor (often the inlet of the plant or gathering system) and at what pressure. For example, it may require gas be delivered at a minimum pressure to enter the system​
D11O58IT1BHUT6.CLOUDFRONT.NET
. If the producer’s well pressure drops, the producer might need to install booster compression to meet this. Likewise, the processor will deliver residue gas back at a certain pressure sufficient to enter downstream pipelines​

.
Gas Quality Specifications: Detailed gas quality specs are spelled out. These typically mirror pipeline specs. For instance, inlet gas may need H₂S below a certain ppm, total sulfur below a grain/100scf limit, CO₂ below a percentage, gas free of liquid water and sand, etc.​

. If the producer delivers off-spec gas, the processor can refuse it or process it at additional cost to the producer. Often there are penalties or fees for treating off-spec gas (e.g. an “CO₂ handling fee” or an obligation on the producer to remove contaminants).
Fuel and Shrinkage Allocation: The contract defines how fuel gas (gas used to run the plant processes) and shrinkage (the loss of gas volume due to NGL extraction) are accounted for. In a fee-based deal, typically the producer’s delivered volume is reduced by a fuel percentage and shrink, but since the producer keeps NGLs, they bear that loss. In POP deals, both parties effectively share the shrink because it reduces total residue sold (or sometimes shrink is taken out before calculating proceeds split). Some contracts explicitly specify a fuel gas percentage that the processor can use free of charge; beyond that, the processor might have to compensate the producer or take from their share​

. The treatment of shrinkage is important in keep-whole vs POP – as noted, in POP both sides have aligned incentive to minimize excessive fuel use​

.
Fees and Pricing: If a fixed fee or tiered fee is involved, the amount is stated (and sometimes indexed to inflation via PPI/CPI adjustments over a long contract). POP percentages are stated. If products are sold by the processor on behalf of the producer, the contract might detail how pricing is determined (e.g. “based on OPIS Mont Belvieu average for the month of delivery, less transportation fractionation (T&F) costs of $0.05/gal” or similar). For residue gas, if the processor returns it, perhaps a value is ascribed for settlements.
Term and Renewal: Midstream contracts often have long primary terms (10–20 years, especially if the processor invested in new facilities for the producer). There may be evergreen or renewal clauses, or volume-based term (e.g. lasts until a certain cumulative volume is processed).
Force Majeure and Downtime: Conditions that excuse performance (like natural disasters, plant outages, etc.) are defined. For example, if a plant is down for unplanned maintenance, the processor might be relieved of obligations temporarily (and producers might have to flare or curtail). A good contract will clarify what happens in such cases and how quickly the processor must remedy issues.
Testing and Measurement: It will specify that gas volumes and composition are measured by industry-standard equipment (meter runs, chromatographs) and how often these are calibrated. Rights to audit measurements may be included for the producer.
Title and Risk: Typically, the producer retains title to the gas until it reaches the plant and the NGLs until sold, but the processor may assume custody at the inlet and is responsible for it during processing. Liability for losses (e.g. if some gas is lost in an accident) is allocated.
Settlement Statements: The contract will require the processor to provide periodic statements showing volumes processed, NGL quantities recovered, fuel used, shrink, and the resulting proceeds split or fees charged. This transparency is crucial for the producer to see how their gas was handled and to verify revenues.
These terms ensure clarity in how the midstream operation is run and how revenues/expenses are shared. They also set expectations so that, for instance, a producer knows they must deliver gas within spec and a processor knows what they’re expected to return or pay.
NGL Marketing and Pricing Strategies
The marketing of NGLs extracted in processing is another important aspect covered in or alongside processing agreements. In some contracts, the producer might take their NGLs in kind and market them independently. In others, the processor markets all NGLs (leveraging their expertise and aggregation volumes) and then pays the producer their share of proceeds. Large midstream companies often have marketing arms that sell purity NGL products to refineries, petrochemical plants, or LPG exporters. Pricing for NGLs is usually benchmarked to hub prices (Mont Belvieu for most of North America, or Conway for certain Midcon deals). For example, a contract might stipulate that the price of propane will be “Mont Belvieu average price for the delivery month, as published by OPIS, minus $0.02/gal for fractionation and transport”. That $0.02/gal is effectively the cost to get the mixed NGL to fractionation and then to market, which the midstream company incurs. Negotiating that T&F (transportation and fractionation) fee is part of processing deal economics – a lower T&F means more value to share between producer and processor. NGL marketing also involves logistical planning: storage is key because NGL production can be steady while demand can be seasonal (propane builds in summer, draws in winter). Midstream firms use storage caverns at hubs like Mont Belvieu to stockpile NGLs and manage timing of sales. Some processing contracts allow the processor to temporarily reduce extraction of certain NGLs if there’s no market (for instance, during an ethane glut, the processor can reject ethane into gas to avoid practically giving it away). This flexibility benefits both parties since it maximizes overall value (ethane left in gas still has fuel value). Best practices in NGL marketing for midstream companies include diversifying the customer base (e.g. selling propane to both domestic retailers and international importers), using financial hedges (there are swaps for Mont Belvieu propane, etc.) to stabilize margins, and investing in downstream assets like export terminals to access global markets (which can increase netback prices for NGLs). From the producer’s perspective, if they retain title to NGLs, they need to either become experts in NGL trading or more commonly, allow the processor to handle it for a fee or share.
Industry Challenges, Economics, and Best Practices
The midstream and NGL sector faces several challenges and follows certain best practices to ensure efficiency and profitability:
Volume Variability and Infrastructure Lag: Gas production can surge quickly (as seen in shale booms), but building processing plants and pipelines takes time and capital. This can lead to temporary bottlenecks (e.g. the Permian in 2018 saw gas flaring increase because processing and takeaway capacity lagged production). Best practice is for midstream companies to closely coordinate with producers’ development plans, sometimes building infrastructure ahead of demand (with contractual commitments) to avoid flaring or shut-ins. In regions like the Marcellus, midstream build-out had to race to catch up with enormous gas volumes. Adaptive strategies include modular plant additions and interim solutions like portable compression or refrigeration units.
Commodity Price Swings: Midstream profitability can be affected by gas and NGL price shifts, especially under POP or keep-whole contracts. A dramatic example was in late 2000: a cold snap sent natural gas prices soaring to ~$10/MMBtu while NGL prices lagged, collapsing processing margins​

. Many keep-whole processors were operating at a loss (because the NGLs they extracted were worth less than the gas BTUs they had to replace). In response, some processors shut off ethane recovery (to reduce shrink) and even negotiated temporary relief with producers (converting contracts to POP or adding fees until economics normalized)​
OGJ.COM
. The lesson learned was the importance of contractual flexibility or hedging. Today, midstream firms often hedge a portion of their exposure (e.g. using swaps for NGL prices) and include contract clauses to mitigate extreme situations (such as “ethane rejection rights” or cost-sharing triggers).
Regulatory and Environmental Pressures: Midstream operations must comply with environmental regulations (e.g. emissions controls on compressors, leak detection and repair for processing plants to limit methane emissions, etc.). They also face public scrutiny for pipeline routing (leading to more robust stakeholder engagement on new projects). Best practices involve adopting new technologies: electric-driven compressors in some areas to cut emissions, better flare systems and cryogenic processes to minimize flaring, and continuous monitoring for leaks. Also, in response to incidents, the industry has improved safety standards – for example, after a storage leak in California (Aliso Canyon) and various NGL accidents, regulations tightened on underground storage and NGL facilities. Companies proactively conducting risk assessments and maintaining infrastructure can prevent costly accidents and downtime.
Integration and Hubs: There is a trend of integrating midstream services – companies that handle gathering, processing, fractionation, and even export, all under one umbrella, can optimize the value chain. For instance, a company like Enterprise Products may gather gas, process it, fractionate NGLs, and export propane, capturing value at each step. This integration is a competitive advantage and a best practice for maximizing margin and offering producers better netbacks. Developing hub centers (like Mont Belvieu for NGLs, or regional gas hubs) with multiple connections and storage is another best practice, as it creates liquid markets and optionality.
Economics of Scale: Larger plants and pipelines often mean lower unit costs. Thus, midstream economics favor consolidation of volumes. We see this in larger processing complexes with multiple trains that achieve better energy efficiency and economies of scale, and in big diameter pipelines that move more gas at lower cost per unit. The challenge is ensuring those big investments get utilized. Long-term contracts and anchor shippers are used to justify big projects (e.g. a new NGL pipeline or a mega-processing plant).
In conclusion, the midstream and NGL sector forms the critical link between upstream production and downstream consumption. By adhering to sound engineering practices, smart contracting, and market-responsive operations, midstream companies manage to deliver gas reliably, meet quality specs, and extract additional value (NGLs) even amidst a changing energy landscape. The continuing growth of natural gas usage (including LNG exports and petrochemical demand) keeps midstream infrastructure development a dynamic field, where best practices evolve with technology and market conditions.
Gas Processing Contracts and Negotiations
Historical Context: Regulated to Deregulated Gas Markets
The framework for natural gas contracts and marketing has been profoundly shaped by the industry’s regulatory history. In the early decades (mid-20th century), many gas transactions were governed by long-term contracts with regulated prices. Interstate natural gas prices in the U.S. were controlled by the Federal Power Commission, leading to shortages in the 1970s. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 began phasing out price controls on wellhead gas​
DIVERSEGY.COM
, and the 1980s saw incremental steps towards competitive markets. Pivotal was FERC Order 436 (1985) which introduced open-access transportation, and ultimately FERC Order 636 (1992), known as the Final Restructuring Rule, which fully unbundled natural gas sales from transportation​
DIVERSEGY.COM
. After 1993, pipeline companies became strictly transporters; producers and buyers could contract directly and use pipeline capacity separately. This ushered in a deregulated market era with gas-to-gas competition. Legacy long-term contracts were either restructured or exited (with significant “take-or-pay” settlement negotiations in the late 1980s). Under regulation, gas contracts had been static (often fixed price or crude-oil indexed, with inflexible terms). Post-deregulation, new contract models emerged: shorter-term agreements, market-indexed pricing, and greater reliance on spot market transactions. An example of historical restructuring: a utility that once bought all gas from a pipeline at an regulated price now had to procure gas from producers or marketers, and separately book transport on pipelines via firm contracts or capacity releases. This increased the complexity and need for gas marketing professionals who could negotiate deals, arrange logistics, and manage price risk. Similarly, natural gas liquids (NGL) marketing matured over time. NGLs were traditionally by-products sold by refineries or gas processors in bilateral contracts. But with the surge in gas processing, especially since the 2000s, NGLs became a large-volume market with hub pricing (Mont Belvieu hub pricing became a reference by the 1980s–90s). Historically, some NGL prices were linked to crude oil or fuel uses (propane often tracked oil). Over time, distinct markets for each NGL developed (ethane linked to ethylene demand, propane to seasonal heating and petrochem, etc.). By the 2010s, an increasingly global market for NGLs (LPG exports, ethane exports) influenced contract considerations. In summary, the movement from a regulated environment to a restructured, deregulated market required gas contracts to become more flexible, market-based, and complex. Negotiators today operate in a context where price volatility is expected but also where financial instruments exist to manage that volatility. The legacy of deregulation is that contract negotiation and marketing savvy replaced regulatory navigation as the key skill.
Modern Gas Marketing: Market Factors and Hedging
In today’s gas industry, gas marketing deals with a variety of contract types and strategies. Market factors that influence negotiations include supply forecasts (e.g. expected production from shale plays), demand outlook (e.g. upcoming winter severity, industrial growth, LNG export demand), and infrastructure status (new pipelines, storage levels). Both buyers and sellers keep an eye on these when structuring deals. For example, if storage levels are low and a cold winter is projected, a buyer might prefer to lock in a price now (perhaps via fixed-price forward contract or call option) rather than risk high spot prices later. Conversely, a producer in that scenario might choose more spot exposure, betting on higher prices. Contracts in gas marketing can be long-term supply agreements (often 1-5 years in modern context, occasionally longer for power plants or LNG terminals) or short-term deals (one month to one season). A common structure is an index-priced contract: the buyer agrees to pay a published index price (like “Henry Hub Month Ahead” or a regional index) plus or minus a basis differential. This ensures the price reflects market conditions while guaranteeing delivery. Negotiations for these contracts focus on the basis differential and any volume flexibilities or options (e.g. swing volumes, the ability to vary take within a band). Because gas prices can swing significantly, hedging is integral to contract strategy. Many contracts explicitly allow or require certain hedging: for instance, an LDC (local distribution company) might issue an RFP for gas supply where they favor offers that come with a financial hedge to cap price. Financial derivatives like futures, swaps, and options are used hand-in-hand with physical contracts. A producer negotiating a fixed price contract at $3.50/MMBtu may hedge by selling NYMEX futures at that price to ensure they can deliver at that cost. A power plant with an interruptible gas deal might buy call options on gas as insurance against price spikes if they have to go to spot market. On the trading side, gas hubs like Henry Hub (US), AECO (Canada), NBP (UK), TTF (Netherlands) have highly liquid markets. Contracts for differences (CFDs) or basis swaps are used to hedge the differential between Henry Hub and other points. For example, a Marcellus producer selling gas at “NYMEX minus $0.50” might hedge their exposure by also locking in that $0.50 basis via a financial swap. In negotiations, credit and counterparty risk is another factor. After some notable failures (e.g. the Enron collapse in 2001 affected many gas trades), contracts include credit provisions: posting of collateral or letters of credit, especially for long-term deals. Price volatility means mark-to-market exposures can grow, so counterparties negotiate credit thresholds and margining requirements in their ISDA or NAESB (North American Energy Standards Board) agreements. NAESB base contracts are widely used in North America for physical gas trading, providing standardized terms with negotiable schedules for specifics like delivery point, price, etc. Hedging case study: A municipal utility might negotiate to buy 50% of its expected winter gas needs at a fixed price (hedging that portion against price spikes), 30% at index (to benefit if prices moderate), and leave 20% optional (with a supplier-provided option or simply plan to buy spot if needed). The supplier selling the fixed portion will likely hedge it on NYMEX or via storage injections. Both parties will include clauses on what happens if the buyer takes less or more than expected (swing flexibility, which often has a tolerance band like +/- 10% without penalty). Such balanced portfolios are now common best practice in gas contracting. In essence, modern gas marketing negotiations strive to create win-win contracts where each side can manage its risks: sellers secure outlets for production (often required by lenders for project financing) and buyers secure reliable supply (important for keeping the lights on and homes heated), while both use financial hedges to lock in acceptable economics.
NGL Marketing: Contracts and Trends
Marketing of natural gas liquids (NGLs) is somewhat distinct from natural gas but shares some parallels. NGL contracts are often commodity-specific since each NGL has its own market. For example, a gas processor (or producer taking NGLs) might have a contract to sell propane to a wholesaler, and another to sell ethane to a petrochemical plant. Historical trends: In the past, NGL prices in contracts could be linked to crude oil (because NGLs were substitutes in refineries or heating markets). Now, they are typically indexed to hub spot prices (Mont Belvieu or Conway in the US). Transportation and fractionation (T&F) fees are a key component: when selling raw NGL mix, contracts account for the cost to fractionate and deliver purity products. Increasingly, producers strike deals with midstream companies for “NGL takeaway”, meaning the midstream company will take the raw NGL mix at the plant tailgate and handle everything (fractionation, marketing) for a fee. These agreements simplify the producer’s responsibility. For example, a contract might say the processor will pay the producer netback prices for each NGL equal to Mont Belvieu price minus a fixed processing cost. In effect, this is like a POP contract expressed in product terms. Some producers prefer this if they want a clear formula and not worry about marketing each product. Others (usually larger ones) might hire NGL marketing specialists to get possibly better deals by timing sales or exporting. Current trends in NGL contracts include:
Export-linked deals: With growing exports of propane and butane, some contracts with export terminals or traders might be indexed to international benchmarks (e.g. ARA or Far East Index) minus a shipping cost. This is an evolving area as US became a major LPG exporter.
Ethane supply agreements: Ethane, being very tied to petrochemicals, often moves under contracts with cracker operators. These may involve volume commitments (a petrochemical plant might require a supplier to deliver X barrels of ethane per day, with price = Ethane Mont Belvieu plus transportation). If a new cracker is built, it typically signs long-term ethane supply deals to ensure feedstock, and those contracts can be 5–10 years with price tied to ethane indices.
Quality specifications: NGL contracts (especially international ones) specify purity (e.g. propane minimum 95% C3, max butane content, sulfur limits, etc.). These specs have to be met by the fractionation process, and any off-spec NGL can lead to price discounts or rejection.
Seasonal optionality: Some propane contracts allow the buyer (typically a retailer or petrochemical) to vary take seasonally. The seller (processor) must plan storage or alternate buyers for summer surplus. They might negotiate a premium for such flexibility or retain the right to sell excess in spot market.
From an economic view, NGL margins can significantly impact gas processing negotiations. If NGL prices are robust, processors and producers both benefit, so POP contracts go smoothly. If NGL prices collapse (as happened in mid-2015 when oil and NGL prices fell sharply), producers might reevaluate drilling wet gas vs dry gas, and processors might push for more fee-based elements to cover operating costs. The industry has seen instances where very low ethane prices led to ethane rejection on a massive scale (~2012–2013 in the U.S.), affecting petrochemical feedstock supply – thus, new investments in ethane-consuming plants were negotiated with assurances of ethane supply, sometimes in the form of ethane-only contracts separate from the rest of the NGLs. In negotiations for NGL marketing, one best practice is transparency: since NGL pricing can be opaque to those not actively trading, processors provide detailed index-based settlement info. Many contracts use an average of published prices (to mitigate any day-to-day volatility or pricing anomalies). Both parties will also agree on timing (e.g. monthly pricing vs daily) and how prompt payment is made after delivery or lifting.
Processing Agreement Structures: Evolution and Key Players
Gas processing agreements have evolved alongside these marketing changes. Historically (1960s–1980s), many processing plants were owned by pipeline companies or joint ventures, and contracts were often keep-whole. In the modern era, dedicated midstream companies (many structured as MLPs or similar) are key players negotiating processing contracts with producers. Key players in various regions include Enterprise, Targa, Williams, MPLX, Enbridge, etc., and they often negotiate dozens of contracts with producers across their systems. Each producer might have slightly different terms based on their size and negotiating power. Historical margins: In the mid-2000s, gas was relatively expensive and oil (hence NGL) was moderately high, giving healthy margins for processing (especially for keep-whole: NGL “frac spread” – difference between NGL basket value and gas value – was high). After 2008, gas prices plunged with the shale boom, but oil and NGL initially stayed high, creating windfall profits for processors under keep-whole or POP (since gas was cheap to replace, NGL were valuable). This attracted new entrants and capital into gas processing. However, around 2015, oil prices crashed, dragging NGL prices down while gas prices had somewhat recovered – a squeeze for processors (frac spreads narrowed). Many contracts had to be revisited. We saw a general trend: more contracts shifted to fee-based or hybrid structures to protect processors from commodity risk, especially when seeking financing for new plants (banks prefer steady fee income over volatile share of proceeds). POP contracts didn’t disappear, but processors tried to at least secure a portion of revenue as fixed. Producers, on their side, if they believed in high NGL prices, were fine with POP (they share upside), but if they were uncertain, they might gravitate to fee deals to just pay a toll. The evolution of processing deals and economics can be summarized: from keep-whole dominance (producer got gas back, processor took liquids) → to POP dominance (shared value) → and increasing fee elements (especially for new infrastructure deals). Some companies even offer all three types tailored to different producer needs.
Negotiation Strategies and Considerations
Negotiating a gas processing contract requires balancing risk and reward. Producers generally want: maximum value for their gas (either via getting NGL revenues or low fees), flexibility if their production fluctuates, and assurance that the midstream can take their gas (avoiding shut-ins). Processors want: a fair return on the capital they’ve invested in plants and pipes, some protection against adverse price moves, and guaranteed throughput or acreage dedication to secure future volumes. Key strategies and considerations include:
Choosing the Contract Type: This is the heart of negotiation. If commodity prices are in a stable or bullish outlook, a producer might be comfortable with POP or even keep-whole (to potentially get more value). If commodity price is uncertain or the producer is risk-averse (or perhaps their lenders require stable cash flow), they’ll push for fee-based. A compromise could be a tiered structure (fee plus small POP). The processor will run economics for various scenarios and often will present multiple options to the producer, essentially showing “here’s the fee-only deal vs. here’s the POP deal with higher potential payout if NGLs are strong.” This choice often depends on both parties’ view of future NGL prices relative to gas (the frac spread).
Risk Mitigation: If a POP/keep-whole is selected, producers might ask if the processor is hedging the NGL and gas prices. Sometimes, a midstream will commit to a hedging program and even include it in the contract or at least in discussions (to reassure producers that extreme scenarios are covered and the plant will keep running). In some cases, floors or collars are embedded: e.g. a keep-whole contract could have a clause that if processing margin is negative (NGL value falls below gas value by X), the parties will switch to a POP split or temporary fee to keep the plant running. This was a lesson from the 2000 and 2010s downturns.
Capital Cost Sharing: If a producer’s volumes require a new plant or major expansion, the processor may seek assurances like minimum volume or a capital recovery fee. Negotiation might involve capital contributions by producers – occasionally producers have invested in processing plants to secure capacity. Alternatively, a longer-term dedication or acreage dedication gives the processor confidence to invest. Processors might negotiate an Area of Dedication (AOD) where the producer commits all production from a geographic area to that processor, preventing them from shopping gas to other processors if economics change. Producers negotiate the size and term of AOD carefully, as it can affect future flexibility or if they sell the assets.
Pricing Details: When splitting proceeds, how to value the products is critical. Negotiators will pin down which price indices are used (month average vs daily, which publication), and what costs are netted out. Processors typically net out the fractionation and transportation cost to get NGLs to market. Producers might try to minimize those deductions. For example, if a plant is connected to Mont Belvieu by the processor’s own pipeline, the producer will scrutinize the pipeline fee. Transparent, published tariffs (if it’s an open pipeline) help; if not, this becomes a negotiation point. In some deals, a marketing fee is also charged by the processor if they handle product marketing. Producers often push back on extra fees if the POP percentage already compensates the processor.
Operational Control: The contract usually grants the processor rights to operate as needed, but producers may negotiate some say in major changes that affect them. For example, if a processor wants to shut down for maintenance, giving notice and maybe arranging alternate handling (routing gas to another plant) could be stipulated. In keep-whole deals, producers sometimes want the right to take their gas elsewhere if the processor isn’t recovering efficiently (since the producer only gets paid in gas BTUs, they’d worry if NGL extraction isn’t maximized). Conversely, processors might include clauses that they can reject ethane without producer’s consent if it’s uneconomic, which producers must accept because of overall value.
Duration and Exit: Negotiating term can be sensitive. Producers prefer shorter terms for flexibility, but processors, having invested capital, want long commitments. A middle ground might be a moderate primary term (say 7-10 years) with automatic extensions unless notice given. Early termination rights are rare, but sometimes a producer might negotiate an out-clause if, for example, the plant consistently underperforms recovery or if regulations force changes (like carbon taxes making processing uneconomic – very scenario-dependent). Usually, contracts are pretty binding, and any renegotiation has to be mutual. In times of market turmoil, we have seen voluntary renegotiations: e.g. in 2020 when COVID-19 caused a demand crash, some producers and processors worked out temporary fee relief or volume deferrals to avoid bankruptcies on either side.
Case Study – Negotiation in Practice: A midstream company is proposing to build a new gas processing plant to handle a shale play’s output. They approach producers with an offer: a 10-year POP contract, processor keeps 25% of NGL proceeds, with $0.00/mcf fee (fuel self-consumed) and producer gets 75% of NGL value and all residue gas. One large producer negotiates that down to 20% for processor but agrees to dedicate acreage for 15 years (ensuring the plant has sufficient gas even if wells decline or new wells are drilled). The producer also secures a clause that if their production exceeds plant capacity, the midstream will expand or allow blending of NGL to stay online. In exchange, the midstream gets a higher POP % on volumes above a certain threshold (an incentive to expand). Both also agree if ethane price falls below a ratio to gas for 3 consecutive months, the plant can reject ethane without breach. This hypothetical illustrates the give-and-take: percentage, term, volume commitment, and flexibility.
Key Case Studies and Real-World Applications
To illustrate, consider an actual case from the mid-2000s: A Rockies producer had a keep-whole contract with a processor. When hurricanes and cold weather sent gas prices up in 2005, the processor was returning a lot of expensive gas and only getting cheap NGLs – they were losing money on every unit. The processor approached the producer and both agreed to amend the contract to POP during that high-price period​
OGJ.COM
. They suspended the keep-whole obligation (so the producer temporarily accepted a share of NGL instead of full Btu replacement) until economics normalized. This collaboration prevented the plant from shutting down (which would have forced the producer to flare or shut in gas). The incident prompted many such contracts in the region to be rewritten entirely to POP or fee-based. It also taught producers that insisting on keep-whole could backfire if it caused plant outages when they needed them most. Another case: In the Marcellus Shale early days (~2010), many areas had no local processing. Midstream companies negotiated processing/gathering agreements simultaneously – producers would dedicate gas, and midstream would build both gathering lines and plants. One challenge was the liquids takeaway: there was little local fractionation, so midstream built pipelines to ship NGL mix to the Gulf Coast. Those deals had to factor in high transport costs. Some producers opted to pay a higher gathering fee but keep NGL ownership and arrange their own fractionation later, while others gave the midstream a higher POP% to avoid dealing with NGL logistics. Over time, as regional fractionators were built, newer contracts started giving producers better terms (since infrastructure was in place). This shows how contract terms can improve for producers as midstream build-out matures (early entrants often bear higher fees or more onerous terms due to higher risk for midstream). Real-world insight: By 2020s, with a lot of data on how different contracts perform under various markets, sophisticated models are used in negotiations. It’s common for both sides to run scenarios (high oil price, low gas price; low oil, high gas; etc.) and see how each would fare under a proposed contract. They often seek a deal that is fair across a range of scenarios, not just one side winning in one case and losing badly in another. This balance ensures a durable partnership. Midstream companies sometimes highlight that if they take too much commodity risk and go under, the producer also loses flow assurance – so a stable contract is mutual interest. Finally, NAESB standard contracts provide a template for general gas sales and purchases. Many processing contracts incorporate NAESB terms by reference for measurement, force majeure, dispute resolution, etc., to streamline negotiations. This standardization is a best practice that reduces misunderstandings and legal costs. When disputes do arise (say over whether the processor maximized NGL recovery or properly reported volumes), contracts usually require good-faith negotiation first, and if not resolved, arbitration. Litigation is rare but has occurred, for instance royalty owners suing over POP contract deductions – hence clarity in contracts is critical. In conclusion, gas processing contracts and negotiations represent a sophisticated dance of engineering economics and market finance. Parties must anticipate not only the current market but also how things can change, and embed enough flexibility and risk-sharing so that the partnership remains beneficial through cycles. Successful negotiations result in contracts that enable gas to flow uninterrupted, ensure both producer and processor earn a reasonable return, and adapt to the evolving landscape of gas and NGL markets.
