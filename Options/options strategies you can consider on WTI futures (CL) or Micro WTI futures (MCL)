Below are several options strategies you can consider on WTI futures (CL) or Micro WTI futures (MCL), based on the types of bullish, bearish, or neutral outlooks you might develop from the supplied fundamental data. I’ll also show how to blend in key technical signals (e.g., moving averages, Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, pivot levels) to improve your timing and risk management.

1. Bullish Outlook Strategies
Use these if your fundamental view (e.g., tighter‐than‐normal crude inventories, strong refinery runs, solid diesel or gasoline demand) suggests rising WTI prices.

A. Bull Call Spread
Structure: Buy a near‐the‐money (ATM) call, sell a higher‐strike call in the same expiration.

Example: If CL is trading around $67, you might buy a 67 call and sell a 70 call.
Outlook: Moderately bullish. You expect prices to rise but not explode too far beyond your upper strike.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: Net debit paid.
Max gain: The difference between strikes minus net debit.
Fundamental Tie‐In: If EIA data shows below‐average crude and product inventories (bullish) and you foresee continued supply/demand tightness for the near month.
Technical Confirmation:
Price trading above the 50‐day moving average or showing a bullish MACD crossover.
RSI recovering from oversold or crossing back above 50.
B. Bull Put Spread
Structure: Sell a near‐the‐money put, buy a lower‐strike put for protection.

Example: If CL is $67, sell a 66 put, buy a 63 put.
Outlook: You’re bullish to neutral—you expect prices to stay above your short‐put strike.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: The difference between strikes minus the net credit received.
Max gain: Net credit received.
Fundamental Tie‐In: If, for instance, you see strong gasoline or diesel crack spreads and tight inventories, but you’re comfortable with the idea that “even if WTI dips a little, it won’t collapse.”
Technical Confirmation:
Bollinger Bands show price bouncing off the lower band in an uptrend.
Pivot levels: Price trading above daily/weekly pivot, signifying a bullish short‐term bias.
C. Call Ratio Backspread (for a More Aggressive Bullish Bet)
Structure: Typically buy more calls than you sell (e.g., sell 1 call at a lower strike, buy 2 calls at a higher strike).

Example: Sell 1 at‐the‐money call (strike $67), buy 2 out‐of‐the‐money calls (strike $69).
Outlook: You’re expecting a strong upside breakout.
Risk/Reward:
Downside risk is capped or offset by the credit/debit structure (depends on how you set the strikes).
Upside potential can be significant if WTI rallies beyond your long strikes.
Fundamental Tie‐In: If you expect a sudden supply shock or a strong demand surge (e.g., OPEC production cuts, unexpectedly large inventory draws).
Technical Confirmation:
A Bollinger Band “squeeze” signaling a volatility breakout is imminent.
MACD rising firmly above zero, or a bullish pivot break above R2.
2. Bearish Outlook Strategies
Use these if your fundamental view (e.g., above‐average production, large product builds, weakening diesel/gasoline demand) suggests downside or capped prices.

A. Bear Put Spread
Structure: Buy a near‐the‐money put, sell a lower‐strike put in the same expiration.

Example: If CL is $67, buy a 66 put, sell a 63 put.
Outlook: Moderately bearish. You expect prices to fall but not necessarily collapse.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: Net debit paid.
Max gain: Difference between strikes minus net debit.
Fundamental Tie‐In:
Rising US production (above 5‐year average) with weak demand signals.
A trend of consecutive inventory builds.
Technical Confirmation:
MACD crossing below the signal line in negative territory.
RSI dropping from overbought (>70) down through mid‐levels, indicating potential further weakness.
B. Bear Call Spread
Structure: Sell a near‐the‐money call, buy a higher‐strike call for protection.

Example: If CL is $67, sell a 68 call, buy a 71 call.
Outlook: Bearish to neutral—expect price to stay below your short call’s strike.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: Difference between strikes minus net credit.
Max gain: Net credit received.
Fundamental Tie‐In:
Softer macroeconomic data, e.g., a slowdown in diesel or gasoline demand heading into the shoulder season.
Key pivot: If total crude + product stocks are consistently building above the 5‐year average.
Technical Confirmation:
Price failing at key resistance (pivot R1 or upper Bollinger band).
RSI near or above 70, rolling over.
3. Neutral or Range‐Bound Strategies
Sometimes fundamentals are mixed—e.g., crude inventories are slightly below average, but production is trending higher. You might expect sideways price action until clearer direction emerges.

A. Iron Condor
Structure:

Sell an out‐of‐the‐money call spread (bear call spread).
Sell an out‐of‐the‐money put spread (bull put spread).
All in the same expiration.
Example: With CL at $67, sell the 70/72 call spread and sell the 64/62 put spread.
Outlook: You expect WTI to remain within a specific range.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: The sum of the widths of the spreads minus net credit (if price breaks above the short‐call strike or below the short‐put strike).
Max gain: Net credit received if WTI stays between your strikes.
Fundamental Tie‐In:
Conflicting signals: maybe distillate inventories are tight, but a global economic slowdown is limiting demand.
You expect minimal net price movement over the next few weeks.
Technical Confirmation:
Narrow Bollinger Bands or a pivot “pin” near the daily/weekly pivot, indicating sideways trade.
RSI hovering around 50, MACD near zero with little momentum.
B. Short Strangle (Advanced)
Structure:

Sell an out‐of‐the‐money call.
Sell an out‐of‐the‐money put (same expiration).
Outlook: You expect low volatility and a tight range, but it’s riskier since loss can be large if price makes a big move.
Risk/Reward:
Max gain: Net premium received (if WTI stays within your short strikes).
Max loss: Theoretically unlimited if price rallies/falls sharply.
Fundamental Tie‐In:
Market complacency: e.g., OPEC stable policy, stable EIA data, no strong supply shocks on the horizon.
Technical Confirmation:
Volatility measures (e.g., Bollinger Band width) contracting.
Low MACD histogram, RSI near midpoint, no big trend signals.
4. Calendar Spread or Diagonal Spread
If you believe near‐term fundamentals differ from longer‐term fundamentals, you can exploit time‐based mispricings.

A. Call (or Put) Calendar Spread
Structure:

Sell a near‐term call (or put) at a given strike.
Buy a longer‐dated call (or put) at the same strike.
Example: Sell the CL front‐month 68 call, buy the next‐month (or 2 months out) 68 call.
Outlook:
You expect short‐term price action to stay stagnant or slightly bullish/bearish, but you foresee a bigger move later.
Risk/Reward:
Max loss: Typically limited to the net debit.
Profit can emerge if front‐month time decay benefits you and if the underlying moves enough later to boost the value of the longer‐dated option.
Fundamental Tie‐In:
Near‐Term Bearish, Longer‐Term Bullish: Maybe you expect a short‐term refinery maintenance season or demand lull, but longer‐term supply issues remain (tight inventories, robust future demand).
Near‐Term Bullish, Longer‐Term Bearish: Perhaps you see a short‐term supply shock (e.g., hurricane, pipeline outage) but anticipate that OPEC+ or rising US production will eventually weigh on prices.
Technical Confirmation:
Use short‐term indicators (e.g., pivot points or 9‐day MA) to gauge near‐term direction.
Look at longer‐term MAs (50‐ or 200‐day) for the bigger swing direction.
5. How to Combine Technical Analysis for Better Accuracy
Regardless of which options strategy you choose, integrating technical triggers can significantly improve your entries and risk management:

Bollinger Bands

Use upper or lower band tests to initiate spreads at perceived extremes—especially in sideways or gently trending markets.
Look for “Band Squeezes” to anticipate volatility expansions (a good time to consider ratio backspreads or straddles/strangles if you expect a big move).
Pivot Levels

Set entry triggers around daily/weekly pivots (P, R1, R2, S1, S2).
For example, if you want to initiate a bullish spread, you might wait until price clears R1 or sets a pivot “support” bounce.
MACD & RSI

MACD Crossovers: A bullish crossover can confirm the momentum needed for a bull call spread or bull put spread. A bearish crossover can justify a bear put spread.
RSI Overbought/Oversold:
Overbought (above 70 or 80) can signal a possible short‐term top—consider a bear call spread or short calls if fundamentals also suggest softness.
Oversold (below 30 or 20) can indicate a short‐term bottom—maybe a bull put spread if fundamentals confirm a rebound.
Time Your Trade Around Inventory Releases

If you anticipate a bullish EIA report (e.g., big crude or product draws), consider putting on a bullish option trade just before or right after the data if the technicals align.
If the EIA data contradicts your fundamental expectation, be prepared to manage or exit quickly.
6. Risk Management Tips
Position Sizing:

Options can move quickly, especially around big data releases (EIA, OPEC announcements). Keep your position size small enough to handle volatility.
Stops or Exits:

Even though many option strategies have defined risk, you can still exit early if the market moves against you or if fundamentals shift (e.g., OPEC surprises, recession fears).
Volatility Considerations:

If implied volatility (IV) is high, premiums are richer—credit spreads become more attractive.
If IV is low, debit spreads can be cheaper, but be sure you expect volatility to pick up or the directional move to happen.
Watch the Forward Curve (Strip)

If front‐month and out‐months differ significantly, you can use options on different expirations to capture changes in the term structure—particularly relevant for calendar/diagonal spreads.
Putting It All Together
Fundamentals First

Develop your directional bias (bullish, bearish, or neutral) from inventory levels vs. 5‐year norms, refinery runs, diesel/gasoline price trends, and macro events.
Technical Confirmation

Check Bollinger Bands, pivot points, MACD, and RSI for short‐term vs. intermediate‐term signals that support (or contradict) your fundamental bias.
Select an Options Strategy

If you want a moderately bullish play with limited risk, bull call spread or bull put spread.
Strongly bullish? Consider a call ratio backspread.
Moderately bearish? Bear put spread or bear call spread.
Range‐bound? Iron condor or short strangle (with caution).
Mixed short‐term vs. long‐term outlook? Calendar or diagonal spread.
Manage & Adjust

Monitor new EIA reports and global supply/demand developments.
Adjust or roll spreads if the market moves significantly, or if fundamentals shift unexpectedly.
By blending these option structures with the underlying fundamental outlook from inventories, production levels, and refined product demand—and timing entries/exits via technical analysis signals—you can build a more robust, higher‐probability trading plan for CME WTI (CL) or Micro WTI (MCL) futures options.

Option Strategies with Probabilities and Timing
Reasoned for 1m 57s
Below you’ll find approximate probabilities of profit for each options strategy, along with guidance on when (day/time) you might consider placing these trades—including the New Zealand Time (NZT) equivalents. Note that all probabilities are estimates, typically derived from implied volatility and standard options models. Actual results will vary based on real‐time market conditions, the strike selection, and the distance between strikes.

1. Bullish Outlook Strategies
A. Bull Call Spread
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~45–55%

Because you’re buying a call spread near the money, your POP is around or slightly below 50% (depending on how close the strikes are to the current price).
When to Trade:

Ahead of (or just after) bullish EIA data (released Wednesdays at 10:30 AM US Eastern Time).
NZT Equivalent:
During US Daylight Saving (Mar–Nov): EIA at 10:30 AM ET = 2:30 AM (Thu) NZT
Outside DST (Nov–Mar): EIA at 10:30 AM ET = 4:30 AM (Thu) NZT
After a bullish technical trigger (e.g., MACD crossover, price closing above the 50‐day moving average).
Rationale:

If inventory data shows draws below the 5‐year average (tight supply) and technicals confirm an uptrend, initiating a bull call spread can give you defined risk with a moderately bullish payoff.
B. Bull Put Spread
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~65–75%

Since you’re selling a put spread typically below the current price, you have a higher probability of profit (the underlying can even move slightly against you and you can still profit).
When to Trade:

Early in the trading week (Mon–Tue) if you expect bullish news by EIA Wednesday. You collect premium before implied volatility potentially drops post‐announcement.
Following a bounce off support (e.g., pivot S1 or the lower Bollinger Band in an uptrend).
NZT Equivalent:

Sunday US Globex open is Sunday 6:00 PM ET, which is Monday ~11:00 AM or 12:00 PM NZT (depending on DST). This can be a good time to position for the week if you anticipate bullish fundamentals.
C. Call Ratio Backspread (Aggressive Bullish)
Typical Probability of Profit (POP):

The small profit zone (if the market stays near your strikes) can have a moderate probability (~50–60%), but the big payoff scenario (large rally) usually has a lower probability (~20–30%).
Overall, this strategy often has a decent chance of at least breaking even if structured for a small net credit/debit.
When to Trade:

Just before an anticipated volatility spike (e.g., major OPEC meeting, big EIA surprise) when you expect a significant upside breakout.
Technically: If Bollinger Bands are squeezed (narrow), implying a possible volatility expansion.
NZT Equivalent:

OPEC meetings can happen on weekends or early weekdays in Vienna time. Watch for Sunday announcements, which is Monday morning in NZT. You can place trades right before the US Globex open on Sunday evening (US) = Monday late morning/afternoon NZT.
2. Bearish Outlook Strategies
A. Bear Put Spread
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~40–50%

Similar to a bull call spread but in reverse; you’re buying near the money, so you need a decent downward move to profit.
When to Trade:

Ahead of a potential bearish EIA report (e.g., inventories projected to build above the 5‐year average) or after a weak macro data release (recession fears).
Technically: Bearish MACD crossover, RSI rolling over from overbought (>70).
NZT Equivalent:

Watch Tuesday evening in NZT for any US data that might foreshadow a Wednesday EIA build. Could enter trades late Tuesday NZT (which is Tuesday morning/afternoon US time).
B. Bear Call Spread
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~65–75%

By selling calls above the current market price, you have a higher chance of success if price remains below the short‐call strike.
When to Trade:

After a failed rally at a pivot level or upper Bollinger Band.
If fundamentals show surging production or large product builds without sufficient demand.
NZT Equivalent:

Placing a bear call spread on Wednesday night (NZT) after the EIA release (Wednesday AM US) can be strategic if the data turned out more bearish than expected.
3. Neutral or Range‐Bound Strategies
A. Iron Condor
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~60–75%

Probability depends on how wide your short strikes are. Wider strikes = higher POP, but smaller credit.
When to Trade:

Periods of sideways fundamentals—e.g., balanced supply/demand, no major OPEC news.
Technically: Bollinger Bands contracting, MACD near zero, RSI around 50.
NZT Equivalent:

Might open an Iron Condor right after the EIA volatility subsides on Thursday NZT (Wednesday mid‐day US). The market often stabilizes on Thursday/Friday if there’s no other big news.
B. Short Strangle (Advanced)
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): Can exceed 70–80% if you sell far OTM options

But risk is theoretically unlimited if the market breaks out strongly.
When to Trade:

Low‐volatility environment: If implied volatility is relatively high compared to your outlook for actual price movement, premium is rich and you expect WTI to remain range‐bound.
No major events scheduled (no big OPEC meeting, no significant macro data surprises expected).
NZT Equivalent:

Often best initiated late in the week (Thu–Fri NZT) if the market has calmed down post‐EIA and you don’t foresee weekend risk events.
Be cautious around Sunday night (US) / Monday NZT opens, when weekend geopolitical news can cause gaps.
4. Calendar/Diagonal Spreads (Time‐Based Plays)
A. Call (or Put) Calendar Spread
Typical Probability of Profit (POP): ~50–60%

The front month option often expires worthless if the underlying doesn’t move too fast. Meanwhile, you retain value in the longer‐dated option.
When to Trade:

Mixed short‐term vs. long‐term outlook: e.g., near‐term sideways/bearish but bullish further out (or vice versa).
When implied volatility is lower in the far‐dated month relative to the near‐dated (looking for a possible IV rise later).
NZT Equivalent:

You might initiate on Monday (NZT) if you anticipate a fairly quiet week until EIA but expect a bigger move next month or quarter.
5. Best Times of the Week/Day to Place Trades (With NZT Conversion)
A. Around the EIA Weekly Inventory Release
US Time: Wednesdays at 10:30 AM Eastern
NZT:
During US DST (Mar–Nov): Thursday 2:30 AM
Outside DST (Nov–Mar): Thursday 4:30 AM
Trading Approaches:

Before Release: Enter if you have a strong directional bias or you’re selling premium expecting heightened implied volatility.
After Release: Enter if you want confirmation from the data (bullish or bearish). Often the market’s real move occurs in the 1–2 hours after the number.
B. Weekly Cycle
Monday (NZT): Sunday night US Globex open can see volatility after weekend news. In NZT, that open is typically Monday ~11:00 AM or 12:00 PM.
Tuesday/Wednesday (NZT): The market positions for EIA data. If you expect a bullish surprise, you might enter bullish spreads on Tuesday morning US (which is Tuesday overnight or Wednesday morning in NZT).
Thursday/Friday (NZT): Often calmer after EIA’s volatility. Good for entering neutral strategies if no other events loom.
C. Intraday (US Session)
The most liquid trading typically occurs 8:00 AM–2:30 PM Eastern Time (when US equity and energy pits historically overlap).
In NZT, that’s roughly:
During US DST: 12:00 AM (midnight)–6:30 AM NZT
Outside DST: 2:00 AM–8:30 AM NZT
Many traders prefer to trade during high liquidity to get tighter spreads on options.
6. Putting It All Together: Probabilities + Timing
Identify Your Outlook:

Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral based on fundamental data (e.g., EIA weekly reports, distillate vs. gasoline inventories, OPEC headlines).
Choose a Strategy & Check Probability:

For higher POP (>60%), consider credit spreads (Bull Put, Bear Call), Iron Condors, or Strangles—understanding risk differences.
For more directional trades (~50% POP), debit spreads (Bull Call, Bear Put) or ratio backspreads if you see a bigger move.
Time Your Entry:

If you expect a big move from Wednesday’s EIA data, you might initiate early in the week (Mon/Tue in US = Tue/Wed in NZ) or right after the data is released (Thu NZT).
Avoid times with low liquidity if you want better fills. Typically, US mornings (which is NZT late night/early morning) see heavier volume.
Double Check Key Technical Signals:

MACD crossovers, RSI extremes, Bollinger Band squeezes, and pivot level tests can refine your entry timing.
Example: If fundamentals scream “bullish,” but RSI is at 85, consider waiting for a slight pullback or choose a bull put spread with more room below.
Final Tips on Probabilities & Timing
Probabilities Are Not Static: They derive from implied volatility and can shift quickly with new information (e.g., surprise OPEC cut). Always reevaluate if market conditions change.
Volatility Tends to Rise before major reports (EIA, Fed announcements) and drop afterward—favoring premium selling strategies just before big releases, and possibly premium buying strategies right after if you expect a continued move.
NZT Scheduling: Most major US energy data hits during NZ late nights or early mornings (Wed–Thu). Decide whether you want to be awake to trade the immediate reaction or set limit orders to enter/exit.
By combining these approximate probabilities with optimal trade timing around key fundamental releases—and confirming with your favorite technical indicators—you can significantly refine your WTI (CL) or Micro WTI (MCL) options strategies.
