Natural Gas Basics
Gas Composition, Measurement, Heating Value, and Quality
Composition: Natural gas is primarily methane (CH₄) with varying amounts of other hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes. It can also contain impurities such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N₂), hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), water vapor, and trace gases. The exact makeup depends on the gas source (some reservoirs produce “dry” gas mostly methane, while others produce “wet” gas rich in natural gas liquids).
Heating Value: The energy content of natural gas (often expressed as British Thermal Units per standard cubic foot, Btu/scf) is determined by its composition. Pure methane has a heating value around 1,010 Btu/scf. Heavier hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, etc.) increase the heating value, whereas inert components like CO₂ or N₂ lower it. Pipeline-quality gas typically has a heating value in a narrow range (e.g. ~950–1100 Btu/scf) to ensure consistent performance for burners and turbines.
Quality Specifications: Industry standards and pipeline companies set gas quality requirements to protect equipment and ensure safety. Pipeline-quality gas must be free of liquid water and heavy hydrocarbons (to avoid condensation in pipes) and below limits for impurities. For example, H₂S and total sulfur must be very low (H₂S often <0.25 grain/100 scf) to prevent corrosion and toxicity, CO₂ and N₂ are limited (a few percent max) to maintain heating value, and gas must be dried to a specified dew point. If raw gas doesn’t meet these specs (e.g. high CO₂ or H₂S content in “sour” gas), it needs processing/treating before entering transmission pipelines.
Measurement: Natural gas volume is measured in standardized cubic feet or cubic meters (adjusted for pressure and temperature). However, sales and contracts are often based on energy content, using units like MMBtu (million Btu) or GJ (gigajoules), to account for varying gas quality. Meters (such as orifice meters or ultrasonic flow meters) at custody transfer points record volumes, and gas chromatographs analyze composition to calculate energy content. Accurate measurement is critical for billing and royalty calculations. Industry professionals ensure meters are calibrated and follow standards (like AGA gas measurement protocols) to reduce errors.
Exploration and Production (Mineral Leasing and Pipeline Operations)
Exploration: Finding natural gas involves geological surveys, seismic data analysis, and exploratory drilling. Companies identify likely gas-bearing formations (such as shale basins or sandstone reservoirs) and drill exploratory wells. Modern exploration also leverages technologies like 3D seismic imaging and geological modeling to pinpoint resources. A real-world example is the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in formations like the Marcellus Shale – companies used seismic and horizontal drilling data to locate sweet spots, leading to a boom in exploration activities in the Appalachian region.
Production Operations: Once a gas reservoir is confirmed, production wells are drilled and completed to bring the gas to the surface. Techniques like hydraulic fracturing (for shale gas) or conventional well completions are used to stimulate flow. Production facilities separate natural gas from any co-produced liquids or water at the wellhead. Operators install flowlines and gathering systems to collect gas from multiple wells. Over a well’s life, production must be managed (e.g. by adjusting choke valves or artificial lift in associated wells) to optimize recovery. Safety and efficiency are paramount – for instance, wells are equipped with blowout preventers and monitoring systems to control pressure and prevent accidents.
Mineral Leasing: In most regions (like the U.S.), exploration and production require securing mineral rights through leasing. Companies (lessees) negotiate leases with mineral owners (which can be private landowners or government entities) giving them the right to drill for and produce natural gas in a specified area. A lease typically involves an upfront bonus payment, an agreed royalty (a percentage of production value paid to the mineral owner, often around 12.5%–18.75%), and a set term (e.g. 3-5 years primary term, extendable if production begins). For example, during the shale boom, operators paid significant bonuses to landowners in Pennsylvania and Texas to lock down acreage, and those landowners receive monthly royalty checks based on gas sales. Leases also include terms for surface use, drilling obligations, and environmental protection. Effective leasing strategy is crucial – it determines control over resources and long-term cost obligations (royalties can greatly impact project economics).
Upstream Pipeline Connection: Producers must connect wells to the natural gas grid. This often involves pipeline operations at the field level – installing gathering pipelines from wellsites to processing plants or main transmission lines. Coordination with midstream companies is common: producers either build their own gathering network or more often dedicate their production to a midstream operator who lays the pipelines. Ensuring these connections quickly is practical – without pipeline access, gas might be flared or shut in. Case in point: in rapidly developing fields like the Bakken (North Dakota), lack of gathering pipelines early on led to flaring of associated gas; industry responded by investing in gathering systems to capture and sell that gas. Upstream pipeline operations also include monitoring field line pressures, preventing leaks, and handling any required compression to move gas into higher-pressure trunk lines.
Pipeline Operations, Economics, Storage, and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
Pipeline Operations: Long-distance natural gas pipelines (transmission lines) move gas from producing regions to consumers (power plants, cities, industrial users). These pipelines are typically large diameter and high pressure (e.g. 600–1000 psi or more). Operations involve compressor stations spaced along the line to keep gas moving by boosting pressure as it drops due to friction and off-takes. Control centers oversee gas flow, pressure, and safety systems along the pipeline’s route. Operators manage “linepack” (the amount of gas stored under pressure in the pipe itself) to respond to short-term demand swings. Maintenance and integrity management are continuous tasks – pipelines are inspected (using smart pigs, for example) for corrosion or damage, and rights-of-way are monitored to prevent third-party damage. In practice, reliable pipeline operations are critical: for instance, a pipeline outage or rupture can cause supply shortages and price spikes in the region it serves, as seen when a major pipeline to the US Northeast went down during winter.
Pipeline Economics: Building a pipeline requires heavy upfront investment (for materials, labor, land easements, etc.), but once in service, pipelines operate for decades. Economics often hinge on capacity contracts – users (producers, marketers, utilities) pay reservation fees for firm transport rights. In regulated markets like the U.S. interstate system, pipeline tariffs are overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which allows pipeline owners to recover costs plus a reasonable return. Thus, many pipelines operate like toll roads for gas, charging by volume (e.g. per MMBtu) transported. High utilization of the pipeline capacity improves profitability. From an economic strategy standpoint, companies only build new pipelines when there’s sufficient long-term commitment from shippers (through take-or-pay contracts) or clear market demand. A real-world application: the expansion of pipelines out of the Marcellus Shale was driven by signed long-term contracts with producers and utilities, ensuring the projects would be financially viable. Conversely, if demand falls, pipelines with only spot (interruptible) shipments may struggle to cover fixed costs.
Storage: Natural gas storage provides critical flexibility in the industry. Gas is typically produced at a relatively steady rate, but demand fluctuates daily and seasonally (peaking in winter for heating, and also in summer where gas-fired electricity for cooling is significant). To manage this, gas is injected into underground storage facilities during lower demand periods and withdrawn when demand is high. The main types of underground storage are depleted gas or oil reservoirs, aquifers, and salt caverns. Depleted fields provide large capacity for seasonal storage, while salt caverns offer high withdrawal rates (good for quick responses to short-term spikes). For example, many utilities in the U.S. Midwest store gas over summer in depleted reservoirs and withdraw it in winter to meet heating demand. Effective storage operations ensure supply reliability and help stabilize prices (preventing extreme spikes by cushioning supply/demand imbalances). In addition to underground storage, LNG storage tanks and even pipeline linepack serve as smaller-scale storage options. Industry professionals pay attention to storage levels as a key indicator; for instance, low storage inventory before a winter can signal potential price increases and supply tightness, as was the case in Europe in late 2021 when storage levels were below average.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): LNG technology allows natural gas to be transported overseas or to remote markets by ship. By cooling natural gas to approximately -162°C (-260°F), it condenses into a liquid at about 1/600th of its gaseous volume. This high density liquid can be loaded onto specialized insulated LNG tankers. Liquefaction plants (at export terminals) remove contaminants and chill the gas, while regasification terminals (at import destinations) warm the LNG back into gas and feed it into pipelines. LNG has become a global commodity connecting regional gas markets – for example, gas from the Middle East or U.S. can be shipped to Asia or Europe. The economics involve large capital investments in liquefaction facilities, ships, and import terminals, so LNG is often sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil or gas benchmarks, though a growing spot market exists. Industry insight: LNG provides market optionality; regions with excess gas can export (the U.S. became a top LNG exporter by liquefying shale gas at Gulf Coast terminals), and regions short of gas can import LNG to ensure supply (e.g. Japan relies heavily on LNG for its gas needs, and recently European countries have imported more LNG to offset pipeline supply shortfalls). For professionals, understanding LNG is important because it influences domestic gas prices and offers opportunities for arbitrage – for instance, when Asian LNG prices skyrocket, U.S. LNG export plants may run at full tilt, tightening domestic supply and raising Henry Hub prices slightly. In practice, LNG operations must also carefully manage safety (as LNG is cryogenic) and logistics (shipping schedules, storage tank management, and meeting contract specifications for heating value and delivery timing).
Gas Contracts, Marketing, Pricing, and Strategies
Gas Sales Contracts: Natural gas is typically bought and sold under contracts that specify volume (or delivery obligations), price, and term. Contracts can range from long-term agreements (e.g. a power plant buying a set volume daily for 5-20 years) to short-term or spot deals (month-ahead or day-ahead transactions on a hub). Key contract structures include firm commitments (buyer takes or pays for a minimum quantity, providing the seller revenue certainty) versus more flexible agreements (allowing swing volumes or interruptions). Contracts also define the delivery point (often a market hub or citygate) and any quality requirements. In North America, standardized contracts like the NAESB Base Contract are used by many industry players, streamlining terms for gas trading. Real-world application: A local distribution company (city gas utility) might sign a portfolio of contracts – some long-term firm deals for winter supply security and some shorter/spot purchases to fine-tune volumes – balancing reliability and cost.
Marketing and Trading: Gas marketing involves the commercial activities of buying, transporting, and reselling gas to optimize value. Marketing professionals act as intermediaries between producers and end-users (or between different market hubs). They manage logistics (pipeline transportation capacity, storage positions) to get gas to the markets where demand (and price) is highest. For example, a marketing company might purchase gas from a producer in West Texas, arrange pipeline transport to California, and sell it to a utility there, profiting from regional price differences. Marketers also handle nomination schedules on pipelines and manage imbalances (keeping actual flow vs. scheduled flow in line), although detailed scheduling concepts are beyond this scope. Industry insight: Successful marketing requires deep knowledge of market dynamics (weather impacts, pipeline maintenance events, etc.). In practice, many producers outsource marketing to specialized firms or have in-house marketing teams to ensure their gas finds a buyer every day. The development of market hubs (like Henry Hub in the US or the NBP in the UK) has enabled more fluid trading, with marketers buying gas at one hub and selling at another, capturing “basis” differentials (the price difference between locations) when profitable.
Pricing: Natural gas pricing is driven by supply and demand fundamentals, and it varies across regions and contracts. In competitive markets, prices are often indexed to gas trading hubs. For instance, in North America, the Henry Hub price (set in Louisiana, also the basis for NYMEX futures) serves as a benchmark; other regions trade at a “basis” plus or minus Henry Hub depending on local conditions (pipeline constraints, local production, weather). Pricing terms in contracts might be fixed (a set $/MMBtu for the term) or indexed (e.g. “Henry Hub monthly index + $0.10”). Some industrial contracts abroad have historically indexed gas prices to oil prices (common in LNG contracts and in parts of Europe/Asia, though this is changing). Real-world examples: Volatility is an ever-present factor – cold snaps can send spot prices spiking (for example, during the 2021 Texas freeze, certain localized prices briefly shot above $ hundred per MMBtu), while mild weather and ample supply can cause prices to crash (e.g. US gas prices fell below $2/MMBtu in 2019 with the shale glut). Industry professionals use tools like futures, swaps, or options to hedge against this volatility.
Strategies for Pricing and Risk Management: Both producers and consumers employ strategies to manage price risk and optimize revenue/cost. Common strategies include hedging (locking in prices for future delivery via financial derivatives or fixed-price forward contracts) and diversification of market outlets. A producer might hedge a portion of next year’s production at a favorable price to ensure they can cover their capital expenditures. On the marketing side, companies use storage strategically – buying gas in low-demand periods (lower price), storing it, and selling during peak demand (higher price), capturing seasonal spreads. Another strategy is asset-backed trading: using owned assets like storage or pipeline capacity to leverage price differences (e.g. diverting gas flows to a higher-priced market if transport capacity is available). In terms of pricing strategy, sellers may choose between index-based sales (riding market prices) vs. fixed prices or escalation formulas in contracts depending on their market outlook and risk tolerance. Industry insight: For example, an LNG export developer might secure long-term contracts indexed to oil to finance its project, while leaving some capacity to sell on the spot market – thus balancing stable revenue with exposure to potentially higher spot prices. Producers often evaluate strategy in context: in a low-price environment, some may prefer to lock in guaranteed sales via contracts with end-users, whereas in a rising market, they might opt for more spot exposure to capture upside. The key for professionals is to align contract portfolios and hedges with their company’s financial goals and risk appetite.
Midstream and NGL Basics
Natural Gas Grid and Gas Composition
Natural Gas Grid Overview: The natural gas grid refers to the network of pipelines and infrastructure that move gas from production fields to end users. It includes gathering systems (field pipelines collecting gas from wells), interstate/intrastate transmission pipelines (large high-pressure lines transporting gas long distances), and local distribution networks (lower-pressure pipelines delivering gas to homes and businesses). This grid is highly integrated – for example, in North America, thousands of miles of pipelines interconnect, allowing gas to flow from producing regions like Texas or Pennsylvania to consuming regions like the Northeast or Midwest. Key points in the grid are hubs (trading/transferring locations such as Henry Hub, or AECO in Canada, or NBP in the UK) where multiple pipelines interconnect and gas can be bought/sold or rerouted. Maintaining grid balance is crucial: pipeline operators adjust flows and storage injections/withdrawals to keep pressure stable system-wide, ensuring that supply meets demand at all times.
Gas Composition in Midstream: Raw natural gas coming from wells can vary widely in composition, and the midstream sector is responsible for handling that variability. “Rich” gas (with higher fractions of ethane, propane, etc.) and “lean” gas (mostly methane) require different treatment. One of the midstream operator’s goals is to produce a uniform, pipeline-quality gas that the transmission grid can accept. This means that before gas enters major trunk pipelines, processing plants remove heavier hydrocarbons (to produce natural gas liquids, NGLs) and impurities so that the gas delivered into the grid is mostly methane within quality specs. Differences in composition also occur across the grid: for instance, gas from oilfields might carry heavier components (associated gas often contains NGLs), whereas gas from a dry gas field (like a coal seam or certain shale gas plays) is almost pure methane. Midstream companies design their systems according to the expected gas makeup – e.g., in a region with sour gas (high H₂S/CO₂), they install amine treaters; in a region with high NGL content, they invest in cryogenic processing capacity. Industry insight: An interesting real-world scenario is “ethane rejection” – if the market for ethane is weak, processing plants (especially in areas like the Marcellus/Utica or Rockies) may deliberately not recover ethane and instead leave it in the gas stream (within allowable Btu limits) to be sold as gas. This operational choice shows how gas composition and market economics intersect in the midstream domain.
Gas and NGL Marketing (Pricing Strategies)
Natural Gas Marketing (Midstream Perspective): Midstream companies sometimes act as marketers for the gas they handle. For example, if a processing plant extracts NGLs and delivers dry gas to the pipeline for a producer, that producer (or the midstream company if given marketing rights) will sell the gas into the market. Midstream firms often aggregate gas from many small producers, giving them volume leverage and market access that individual wells wouldn’t have. They may arrange pipeline transportation to move the gas to a liquid trading hub or high-demand area, then sell it – taking a marketing fee or a margin on the price difference. Pricing strategies for gas remain similar: use of index pricing (monthly or daily gas price indices published for various hubs) is common in purchase/sale agreements. A strategy often employed is to secure firm transport capacity on pipelines from the processing area to a major hub, ensuring the ability to sell gas at better prices; this mitigates basis risk (price differentials caused by pipeline bottlenecks). Midstream companies also keep an eye on regional demand trends – for instance, if a new power plant or LNG export terminal is coming online nearby, they may position themselves to supply that demand by marketing gas from their system under contract.
NGL Marketing: Natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butanes, and natural gasoline) have their own markets and pricing dynamics, distinct from dry gas. Midstream operators usually take the lead in marketing NGLs because they operate the processing plants and fractionation facilities that produce these liquids. Propane and Butane (LPG) are globally traded commodities; their prices often track crude oil to some extent and have seasonal swings (propane, for example, spikes in winter in cold climates for heating demand). Ethane is typically not exported as much (except via pipeline or as a minor component of LNG); its market is mainly petrochemical plants that steam-crack ethane to produce ethylene (a plastics precursor). Ethane prices depend on petrochemical demand and the availability of cheaper alternatives (if ethane price is too high, crackers may switch to other feedstocks). Natural gasoline (pentanes+) is used as a diluent for heavy crude or blended into gasoline, so its price correlates with gasoline or crude. Midstream companies often employ pricing formulas to sell NGLs: for example, they might sell propane at “Mont Belvieu monthly average price” (Mont Belvieu, Texas is a major NGL hub with daily posted prices) minus a transportation cost if it’s delivered elsewhere. They might also engage in export contracts for propane/butane, given the large international market (e.g., shipping propane to Europe or Asia from US export terminals under term agreements).
Pricing Strategies for NGLs: Since each NGL component has its own supply/demand, midstream marketers use a few strategies to maximize value:
Product allocation: If storage is available, they might time sales for when seasonal demand is highest (e.g., hold propane produced in summer in storage caverns and sell during winter at higher prices).
Crack spread/Frac spread management: The “frac spread” refers to the differential between the value of NGLs extracted from a gas stream and the value lost from the gas. Midstream firms monitor this spread closely. If the frac spread is wide (NGLs are very valuable relative to gas), they will recover as much as possible and aggressively market those liquids. If it narrows, they might reduce recovery of marginal components (like ethane rejection as mentioned). They may also hedge NGL prices and gas prices to lock in favorable spreads when possible.
Contract mix: Midstream companies often secure a mix of contract types for NGL sales – some long-term contracts (e.g., a 5-year deal to supply an ethylene plant with ethane at an agreed index formula) to ensure steady outlet, and some spot sales to capture upside when market prices are high. For instance, a real-world approach is how Enterprise Products Partners (a major NGL midstream company) will have long-term agreements with propane export customers (providing stability) while also selling additional volumes on the spot market when unexpected cold snaps drive up demand.
Market Hubs and Pricing Points: Just as gas has hubs, NGLs have key pricing points – Mont Belvieu (Texas) and Conway (Kansas) in the U.S. are primary hubs where NGL prices are established. Internationally, hubs like the ARA (Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) for LPG set prices for Europe, and in Asia, benchmarks like the Saudi CP (contract price) influence propane/butane prices. Professionals dealing with NGL marketing stay updated on these reference prices. Insight: An example of pricing strategy is during summer months when propane demand is lower, a marketer might arrange export cargoes to Asia (if Asian prices minus shipping yield a netback higher than Mont Belvieu local price). This arbitrage ensures outlets for surplus product and can support domestic prices from collapsing due to oversupply.
Gas Gathering, Compression, Treating, and Processing
Gas Gathering: Gathering systems are the first link in the midstream chain, connecting the wellhead to central facilities. These are networks of smaller-diameter, lower-pressure pipelines that collect gas from multiple wells and feed it towards processing plants or main trunk pipelines. Gathering lines often span tens of miles across a producing field and can handle multi-phase flow (gas along with liquids) from well production. Key considerations for gathering are maintaining adequate pressure (wells naturally decline in pressure over time, so later artificial lift or compression may be needed), and managing produced fluids (some gathering systems include separation equipment for liquids or handle produced water in parallel pipelines). Practical aspect: Rights-of-way negotiations with landowners and environmental permitting are important when laying new gathering lines. For example, as the Marcellus Shale developed, midstream companies constructed extensive gathering networks in Appalachia, negotiating numerous land access agreements and overcoming hilly terrain challenges to connect hundreds of pads to centralized processing facilities.
Compression: Compressors are used throughout the midstream to move gas efficiently. In field gathering systems, field compression boosts the pressure of gas coming from wells so it can flow into processing plants or into higher-pressure pipelines. Compressor stations typically use engine-driven or turbine-driven compressors (often fueled by a portion of the natural gas from the pipeline itself) to raise gas pressure. As reservoir pressure declines with production, more compression is added to continue drawing gas out ("sucking" on the well). In practice, compression is staged: first at the gathering system inlet if needed, then sometimes at intermediate points if the gathering lines are long, and again at the outlet of processing plants to send gas into transmission pipelines. Midstream operators monitor compressor performance and maintenance closely – a failure can bottleneck gas flow. For example, in a given shale play, if a central compressor station goes down, dozens of wells might have to choke back production until it’s repaired. Efficient compression also minimizes fuel usage (fuel gas burned in compressors is gas that isn’t sold, so lower fuel use = more product to market).
Treating: Gas treating refers to removing contaminants from raw natural gas. The common treating steps include: Dehydration – removing water vapor to prevent pipeline hydrate formation and corrosion (usually done by glycol dehydration units or solid desiccant beds). Sweetening – removing acid gases like H₂S and CO₂; this is often accomplished with amine absorption units that chemically scrub these impurities out. If gas contains significant H₂S, the operation yields byproducts like elemental sulfur (through processes such as the Claus process at sulfur recovery units). Other treating steps can involve mercury removal (activated carbon beds) and sometimes nitrogen rejection (specialized cryogenic or membrane processes if N₂ levels are too high diluting the Btu content). Treating is essential for safety and pipeline integrity – e.g., H₂S is toxic and highly corrosive; even a few ppm can cause stress cracking in pipelines, so “sour gas” fields (like parts of West Texas or Alberta) invest heavily in treating facilities. In real-world context, companies in Alberta process very sour gas (containing several percent H₂S) in large plants, turning the removed sulfur into saleable sulfur blocks. By the time treated gas leaves the plant, it meets all pipeline specs (sweet and dry).
Processing (NGL Extraction): Gas processing is the step that extracts heavier hydrocarbons (NGLs) from the gas stream, yielding residue gas (mostly methane that goes to market) and an NGL mixture. The most common modern method is cryogenic processing, where the gas is cooled and expanded through a turboexpander, dropping the temperature so low (e.g. -100°C or more) that ethane, propane, and heavier hydrocarbons condense into liquids. This allows high recovery of even ethane (deep ethane recovery when desired). Older or smaller plants might use refrigeration or absorption processes (e.g., using oil to absorb NGLs). After initial extraction, a demethanizer column separates methane (goes out as dry gas) from the NGLs. The result is a Y-grade NGL stream (mixed ethane+propane+butanes+pentanes). This stream is usually sent via pipeline to a fractionation facility, unless the processing plant itself has fractionation towers on-site. The economics of processing are significant: by removing NGLs, producers/midstream can sell those liquids for additional revenue, and the remaining gas is within heating value limits for pipelines. Industry application: In liquids-rich plays like the Eagle Ford in Texas, companies built large cryogenic plants (e.g., Enterprise’s Yoakum plant) to capture the high volumes of condensate and NGLs, substantially boosting the value per Mcf of gas produced there. On the other hand, in dry gas areas such as the Haynesville Shale, processing plants mainly dehydrate and maybe slightly process for impurities, since there are few NGLs to recover. Processing also often involves flaring or incineration of waste streams (like if CO₂ or nitrogen has to be vented, or if small amounts of off-gas can’t be recovered), which is carefully controlled under environmental permits.
NGL Fractionation, Markets, and Contracts
Fractionation: Fractionation is the process of separating the mixed NGL stream (Y-grade) into individual product streams: ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, and pentanes+ (sometimes further split into natural gasoline and hexane-plus). Fractionation is done in a series of distillation towers, each one designed to boil off a lighter component and leave heavier ones. For example, a deethanizer tower separates ethane (overhead) from the heavier liquids; a depropanizer then separates propane; next a debutanizer splits butanes from pentanes+. An iso-butane splitter may further separate normal butane and isobutane if needed. These towers use heat and pressure control to achieve separation. Large fractionation complexes exist near market hubs – Mont Belvieu, Texas is the largest in the U.S., handling NGLs from all over the country via pipeline. By the end of fractionation, the products are “purity NGLs” meeting commercial specifications (e.g., ethane purity ~98%, propane commercial grade spec). Fractionation is often a service provided by midstream companies for a fee per barrel; companies with NGL ownership will pay to fractionate their mix or exchange raw mix for equivalent finished products with a fractionator. Real-world note: As shale production surged, Mont Belvieu’s fractionation capacity had to be expanded significantly (several new fractionators were built in the late 2010s) to keep up with the volume of NGLs needing separation – a practical example of midstream infrastructure growing to meet market needs.
NGL Product Markets and Uses: Each NGL has distinct end-use markets, which drive its demand and price:
Ethane: Primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene (via steam cracking). Ethane has limited uses outside petrochem because it’s too volatile to be easily stored as a liquid without pressure. When ethane supply exceeds petrochemical demand (as happened in the early U.S. shale boom), its price can fall so low that producers choose ethane rejection (leaving it in methane gas). When demand is high (e.g., when new crackers open or exports of ethane occur, like ethane shipments from the U.S. to Europe), ethane prices improve.
Propane: Has a broad market – it’s sold as a fuel for heating and cooking (LPG for residential and commercial use, especially in areas beyond the reach of gas pipelines), used in agriculture (grain drying) and as forklift fuel, and also as a petrochemical feedstock (propane can be cracked to make propylene, or dehydrogenated to propylene). Propane demand is highly seasonal in temperate climates (peaks in winter for heating). Global trade of propane is robust; for instance, the U.S. exports propane by ship to Asia and Latin America.
Butanes: These include normal butane and isobutane. Normal butane is blended into gasoline (especially in winter to increase Reid vapor pressure as allowed) and is also feed for petrochemicals (it can be cracked or used in processes like MTBE production historically). Isobutane is mainly used in refineries to feed into alkylation units, which produce high-octane components for gasoline. Both butanes are components of LPG as well, and like propane, they are exported internationally. Demand for butane can spike in summer (gasoline blending season) and isobutane demand ties to refinery runs.
Natural Gasoline (Pentanes+): This is a liquid at ambient conditions and resembles a light gasoline or condensate. It’s used as a diluent for heavy crude oil (heavy oils, like Canada’s oil sands bitumen, are mixed with pentanes+ so they can flow in pipelines). It’s also blended into finished gasoline or used as a petrochemical feedstock for certain processes. Natural gasoline prices tend to track crude oil prices closely.
Insight: The diversity of NGL uses often shields midstream companies from single-market risk – when one NGL product’s market is weak, another might be strong. For example, during a mild winter, propane prices might slump due to lower heating demand, but if at the same time oil prices are high, pentanes+ and butane might command good prices from refiners. Midstream marketing teams optimize the slate, possibly storing one product while selling another aggressively.
NGL Contracts: Contracts for NGLs govern both the fractionation service and the sale of the products. On the service side, a producer or marketer might have a contract with a processor/fractionator to handle their NGL mix, often paying a fee per gallon or per barrel for fractionation and storage. These contracts specify inlet specs for the raw mix, fractionation efficiency, and product deliverables. On the sales side, NGL purchase/sale contracts can be term agreements with fixed differentials to benchmark prices. For instance, a petrochemical company might sign a one-year contract to buy ethane at “Mont Belvieu ethane price + $0.01 per gallon” delivered to their plant. Similar deals exist for propane and butane – e.g., a heating fuel distributor might lock in a summer-fill propane purchase contract to secure supply for winter, at a price indexed to the Mont Belvieu average of the summer months. Internationally, large LPG export deals often use an index like the Saudi Contract Price (CP) as a benchmark.
Logistics and Contract Considerations: NGL contracts also involve logistics elements: pipeline or rail transportation must be arranged for purity products to reach end-users. Midstream companies sometimes enter exchange agreements – for example, exchanging propane in one location for propane in another – to minimize physical transport. Contracts will outline who bears transport costs and losses. There are also specification guarantees – e.g., the fractionator guarantees that the propane sold meets HD-5 spec (a common U.S. propane spec limiting ethane content to 5%). If products are off-spec, the contract will dictate penalties or remediation. Case insight: One practical scenario is in fractionation hubs like Mont Belvieu, multiple producers’ NGLs commingle. Companies often get back an equivalent volume of products after fractionation, not the exact molecules they sent. Thus contracts rely on standard product quality and volume accounting. In the event of pipeline constraints (say, an NGL pipeline is down), force majeure clauses in contracts might be invoked affecting deliveries – professionals must manage such disruptions by having contingency plans (alternate routes or storage). Overall, NGL contracting requires coordinating between gas processing output and downstream demand, locking in fees for services and prices for products in a way that shares risk and reward among producers, midstream processors, and end-users.
Gas Processing Contracts and Negotiations
Gas and NGL Marketing Context (Deregulation and Historical Pricing)
Natural Gas Deregulation History: The marketing of natural gas as we know it today was shaped by deregulation. In the United States, prior to the 1980s, natural gas prices and sales were tightly regulated (with the federal government setting wellhead price ceilings under the Natural Gas Act). This led to distortions like shortages in the 1970s. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 began partial deregulation, and pivotal FERC orders in the 1980s and early 1990s (notably FERC Order 436 and 636) restructured the gas industry. By 1993, pipelines were required to unbundle transportation from commodity sales, meaning producers could sell directly to buyers and purchase pipeline transport separately. This opened up a competitive market for natural gas — gas marketing companies emerged, trading hubs developed, and a futures market on NYMEX was established (Henry Hub futures starting in 1990). Historical pricing reflects this shift: through the 1980s, gas prices moved from being administratively set to market-driven. We saw highly volatile prices in subsequent decades – e.g., price spikes in 2000-2001 (California energy crisis) and 2005 (hurricanes hitting Gulf supply), a peak around 2008 (over $13/MMBtu) followed by a collapse with the shale gas boom (to ~$2 by 2012). Insight for professionals: Deregulation means gas producers must be savvy in marketing; they no longer have guaranteed buyers at set prices. It also means opportunities for profit through trading and optimization, but exposure to price risk is greater. Many companies keep staff who remember pre-deregulation long-term contracts but now operate in a spot-price world.
Modern Gas Marketing Practices: In the post-deregulation era, gas marketing involves short-term contracts, price hedging, and active management of gas flows. Producers often sell at market hubs or at wellhead with pricing tied to a hub minus transport cost (netback pricing). Marketers arbitrage between locations and time periods (using storage). Utilities and large consumers engage in portfolio purchasing (mix of long-term and spot). Over-the-counter and exchange-traded financial contracts allow hedging of price risk for months or years forward. For instance, a power generator might lock in a strip of gas futures for the winter to know their fuel cost. This active marketplace leads to price transparency and efficiency; however, external factors (extreme weather, geopolitics affecting LNG imports/export, etc.) still cause swings. As an example, recent events in Europe (2021–2022) where a supply crunch sent gas prices to record highs highlight how even well-established markets can see extreme volatility, affecting contract negotiations globally as sellers and buyers reevaluate acceptable risk.
NGL Marketing Evolution: NGLs historically were often handled by the same pipeline companies that produced gas (when most gas came from associated oil production, major oil companies and pipeline affiliates managed liquids). With industry restructuring, specialized midstream companies and commodity traders now actively market NGLs. Historical pricing for NGLs has been influenced by oil markets because many NGL uses substitute or complement oil-based products. For instance, propane’s price has long been linked to oil on an energy-equivalent basis, though at times domestic oversupply (as seen in the shale era) caused it to decouple and trade much cheaper than crude on a BTU basis until exports grew. Ethane’s story is unique: it was often left in gas (not explicitly priced) until petrochemical demand grew; now ethane has its own price index and even international price (with ethane exports starting mid-2010s from US to places like Europe and India). Deregulation didn’t affect NGL markets as directly as gas, because NGLs were mostly always deregulated commodities, but the general liberalization of energy markets and the surge in supply post-2010 forced NGL marketers to become more globally oriented. Industry case: Enterprise, Targa, and other midstream players built export terminals to send surplus propane/butane abroad, thus linking U.S. NGL prices to global LPG benchmarks by mid-2010s. For professionals negotiating NGL sales, understanding the interplay with crude oil prices and seasonal factors is key – e.g., a term contract for propane might be indexed to Mont Belvieu, but one must consider how OPEC oil policy or winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere could move that index.
Processing Agreements and Contract Styles
When natural gas is sent to a processing plant to remove NGLs and contaminants, the relationship between the producer (who owns the gas from the well) and the processor (midstream company operating the plant) is governed by a gas processing agreement. These contracts can be structured in several ways, each affecting how value and risk are shared:
Fixed-Fee Contracts: The producer pays the processor a fixed fee for each unit of gas processed, usually quoted in dollars per volume (per Mcf) or per energy unit (per MMBtu) of inlet gas. In this arrangement, the producer retains ownership of all output – the dry gas and the extracted NGLs – and can sell them independently. The processor’s compensation is only that fee, so the processor has no direct commodity price exposure. This is a low-risk deal for processors: they get paid for their service regardless of gas or NGL market fluctuations. Producers benefit by receiving all the upside (if NGL prices are high, they profit fully after paying the nominal fee). This model is common when commodity prices are expected to be strong or for rich gas where the producer is confident in liquids value. It’s also seen in stable, mature areas where processors act as toll service providers. For example, many newer processing agreements in shale plays have shifted to fee-based, as midstream companies (often structured as fee-oriented MLPs) and producers both prefer predictable cash flows.
Keep-Whole Contracts: Under a keep-whole agreement, the processor’s payment is the extracted NGLs themselves. The processor keeps all NGLs removed from the gas and in return delivers back to the producer an equivalent energy amount of gas (or sometimes the same volume of gas) after processing. Essentially, the producer is “kept whole” on gas heating value – they don’t lose energy content by having NGLs stripped out, because the processor either returns replacement gas or compensates the BTU difference. In practice, this often means the processor takes the NGLs and uses a portion of them or some of the inlet gas as fuel to run the plant, then returns the remaining processed methane to the producer. The risk dynamic here is flipped from fixed-fee: the processor carries commodity price risk. If the NGLs’ market value is high relative to the energy value of the gas returned, the processor profits (because they got valuable liquids in exchange for cheaper methane). If NGL prices tank or gas is more valuable, the processor could lose (they gave back more value in gas than the liquids fetched). Historically, keep-whole contracts were popular when gas prices were high and NGL prices low (e.g. in some past eras, processors accepted liquids as payment because liquids didn’t sell for much). But in periods like the late 2000s when oil and NGL prices soared, processors with keep-whole deals made windfall profits while producers felt they missed out. This has sometimes led to re-negotiations or contract conversions when market conditions shift drastically.
Percent-of-Proceeds (POP) Contracts: POP contracts share both the commodities and risks between producer and processor. In a typical POP agreement, the processor sells the NGLs (and sometimes a portion of the gas) and then pays the producer a percentage of the proceeds from those sales, keeping the remaining percentage as the processing fee. For example, a contract might stipulate the producer gets 80% of the revenue from NGL sales and the processor keeps 20%. Some POP contracts also include a percentage split of the residue gas sales (though often it’s just the liquids proceeds shared, with the producer keeping 100% of the residue gas value). Because they split proceeds, both parties have aligned incentives to maximize product value, and both are exposed to price fluctuations. If prices are low, both share the pain (the processor’s 20% of a small number is small, the producer’s 80% is also small); if prices are high, both benefit. Variations on POP include Percentage of Liquids (POL), which is similar but might specifically give the processor a percentage of the physical NGL volumes instead of sales revenue – effectively the same outcome assuming those volumes are sold at market price. POP deals became very common in many regions as a balanced approach: the processor still has some guaranteed value (they take a cut) and the producer doesn’t completely forfeit the NGL upside. In some contracts, a minimum floor or sliding scale might be added – for instance, if NGL prices fall below a threshold, the agreement might switch to a fee-based calculation for that period to protect the processor’s costs.
Hybrid and Other Structures: Beyond the three main types above, real contracts can be hybrids. A processor might charge a small fee and take a small POP percentage – combining stability with upside sharing. Another model is fee with escalation: a fixed fee that increases if product prices exceed a certain level (so the processor gets a bit more when commodities are high). In some cases, especially for new plant development, contracts might include an Area Dedication (producer agrees all gas from a certain acreage will go to that processor) paired with either fee or POP terms – this ensures volume for the processor in exchange for the agreed economic terms. Industry trend note: In recent years, many midstream companies have leaned toward fee-based contracts to satisfy investors who prefer steady cash flows, but they may sweeten deals for producers by offering POP elements or other incentives. For instance, a midstream operator might say “our standard fee is $0.50/MMBtu, but we’ll lower it to $0.30/MMBtu and additionally take 10% POP so you get 90% of liquids revenue” – sharing some risk while ensuring a baseline fee.
Key Contract Terms and Conditions
Regardless of contract style, gas processing agreements contain several important terms and conditions to cover operational and financial details:
Gas Quality and Delivery Specifications: The contract will specify the quality of inlet gas the producer must deliver (e.g., maximum allowable H₂S, CO₂, gas temperature, and that it must be free of liquids or solids). If off-spec gas is delivered, the contract may allow the processor to refuse it or process it at an extra charge. The delivery point (often the flange where the producer’s gathering line connects to the plant) is defined, as is the redelivery point for residue gas back to the producer or their pipeline. Quality specs for the residue gas and NGL products might also be stated, ensuring the producer gets pipeline-quality gas returned and marketable NGLs.
Fees and Payment Terms: How the processor is compensated is detailed – for a fee-based contract, the dollar rate per unit and billing period (monthly, typically) are given. In POP contracts, the exact percentage splits for gas and each NGL (if they vary or if certain products are treated differently) are listed. Some contracts include clauses for fuel gas and shrinkage: usually the producer is charged for fuel gas consumed by the plant (their gas provides the fuel for compressors/reboilers, reducing the volume of gas they get back or its proceeds) and for shrinkage (the volume reduction from inlet gas to residue gas after NGL removal). The contract might say, for example, “Processor shall retain 2% of inlet gas as fuel” or “shrinkage gas is allocated to Producer’s account.” Payment terms specify when the producer is paid for their share of proceeds or when the producer must pay invoices (often netting these values out).
Volume Commitments or Minimums: Many agreements, especially when a processor builds new facilities for a producer, include a Minimum Volume Commitment (MVC) or an acreage dedication. An MVC means the producer agrees to send a certain minimum volume (in MMBtu/day or similar) or else pay for that capacity (a shortfall payment if they deliver less). This ensures the processor can recover investment costs. Acreage dedication means all gas from the producer’s wells in a defined area will be processed by that facility – it’s not a numeric guarantee, but it prevents the producer from shopping around to other processors after the midstream has invested in connecting their acreage. Contracts with MVCs also outline carry-forward mechanisms (if the producer falls short one month but exceeds later, how make-up is handled) and the term length associated with the commitment.
Term and Renewal: The agreement’s duration is stated – some are year-to-year, but many processing contracts run 5, 10, or even 15+ years, particularly if tied to infrastructure development. There may be renewal provisions (automatic extension, or first right to negotiate extension) and termination clauses. If a plant is not yet operational, a start date or condition for commencement is included (e.g., “service to begin no later than X date, otherwise producer can cancel” or vice versa).
Title and Ownership: Contracts clarify when title to the gas and liquids transfers. Typically, the producer retains title to the gas and its constituents up to the plant inlet, then the processor may take title to removed NGLs if the contract gives them those as compensation (e.g., in keep-whole, title of NGLs passes to processor). In POP, sometimes the processor takes title to sell the products and then later pays the producer. Clear title language prevents confusion or legal issues (important for liability and in case of either party’s bankruptcy – it determines whose asset the gas/NGL is at various points).
Other Key Clauses:
Fuel and Losses: As mentioned, usage of some gas for plant operations (fuel) is usually covered – often a percentage is stipulated as assumed fuel consumption. Any losses (e.g., flared gas, measurement variances) might be allocated pro-rata to the producer.
Measurement and Testing: The agreement will state that all volumes and gas compositions will be measured by industry-accepted methods (with meters and chromatographs) and that either party can inspect or audit the measurement equipment. Procedures for addressing meter inaccuracies (like if a meter is found to be out of calibration, how far back adjustments apply) are defined.
Force Majeure: Standard clause relieving parties from obligations for events beyond control (like hurricanes shutting down a plant or downstream pipeline outages). For example, if a hurricane forces a plant offline, the processor isn’t liable for not processing gas during that period, and the producer might have to flare or shut in unless alternate arrangements exist.
Liability and Indemnification: It outlines who is responsible if, say, off-spec gas damages equipment or if there’s an accident. Typically, each party is responsible for what it controls (the producer before the inlet, the processor after), and indemnifies the other for issues caused by its negligence.
Audit Rights: Producers often have the right to audit the processor’s statements and calculations (to verify they are being paid correctly, that the correct price indices and volumes were used).
Special Conditions: In some contracts, if gas has particular challenges (e.g., extremely high CO₂ requiring extra costs, or the need for nitrogen rejection), there might be cost-sharing arrangements or specific language addressing that (like a surcharge per percent of CO₂ removed, etc.).
Understanding these terms is crucial for professionals, as they define operational expectations and financial outcomes. A slight change in a clause (for instance, how gas shrinkage is calculated) can significantly impact a producer’s revenue. Thus, negotiating and reviewing these terms requires both technical and commercial acumen.
Accounting, Settlement Statements, and Negotiations
Accounting and Settlement: Every month, the processor will generate a settlement statement (also called a plant statement) for each producer or shipper whose gas was processed. This statement provides a transparent accounting of inputs and outputs under the contract. It typically includes: total inlet gas volume delivered by the producer, the energy content of that gas, volumes of each NGL component recovered from that gas (or allocated to that producer if multiple producers’ gas is commingled), the volume and energy content of residue gas returned, fuel gas consumed, and any shrinkage. Then the financial side: it will list the gross proceeds from sales of NGLs (using agreed pricing, often referencing published index prices for the delivery month) and, if relevant, the value of any gas taken by the processor. From these gross values, the processor deducts its fee or POP percentage, fuel charges, and any other agreed costs. The result is the net payment to the producer (or invoice to the producer if the fees exceeded the commodity value in some scenario). For example: If a producer delivered 100,000 MMBtu in a month, and 5,000 barrels of NGLs were extracted yielding $200,000 revenue, and the contract is an 80/20 POP, the producer’s share would be $160,000 from NGLs. Suppose the residue gas 90,000 MMBtu was returned and sold by the producer for another $270,000, and the processor’s fuel usage was 2,000 MMBtu (worth $6,000) borne by the producer – all these would be detailed, showing how the producer’s net take is calculated. It’s common for the statement to attach market price sheets (showing which price indices were used, e.g., Mont Belvieu average propane price $0.90/gal) to assure the producer the correct numbers were applied. Accounting departments on both sides will reconcile these statements and handle payment (usually the processor remits payment for the producer’s share of liquids by, say, 25 days after month-end, while any fees owed by the producer might be netted out or invoiced). Accurate allocation is critical: if multiple producers feed one plant, the plant uses either direct analysis of each well’s gas or an allocation based on gas analyses and volumes to attribute the NGLs produced to each producer. This can be complex, so contracts specify the allocation method (often a component balance where each producer is credited with NGLs in proportion to the moles of each component they delivered). Professional tip: Producers will examine these statements carefully; even small errors in gas volume or price application can cost significant money over time. They often audit processors – for instance, checking that the propane volume credited matches what their own flow meters and gas chromatographs might have implied. Processors maintain meticulous records to back up these settlements and usually provide an open-book if audited.
Negotiation Considerations: Negotiating a gas processing contract is a balancing act of economics and operational needs. Producers aim to maximize their revenue from gas and NGLs, so they prefer low fees or high POP percentages, broad rights to downstream products, and flexibility (like no strict minimum volume penalties if their drilling plans change). Processors, on the other hand, invested capital in plants and want secure returns, so they seek a guaranteed volume or revenue floor and a fair share of the liquids value. Key negotiating points include the level of fee or POP split – often influenced by market conditions (if processing capacity is scarce in an area, the processor has leverage to command a higher fee or bigger POP cut; if it’s oversupplied or multiple plants compete, producers negotiate better terms). Another point is contract length: a processor might offer a more favorable rate for a longer commitment. Risk allocation is debated – e.g., who bears the risk of NGL price fluctuations? In a high-price environment, producers may push for fee-based deals to keep upside, whereas processors push for POP. In low-price forecasts, producers might accept POP (sharing downside) if it gets them lower or no fixed fees. Negotiations also cover things like future expansions (does the contract allow the producer to bring more gas than initially planned at the same terms?), and priority rights (if the plant nears capacity, firm commitments get processed first, etc.).
Leverage and market examples: If a new rich-gas play is booming, several midstream companies might court producers with attractive terms to gather and process their gas. In such cases, producers have the upper hand and can secure contracts with low fees, or even get the midstream to pay them an upfront bonus or contribution for rights (less common, but possible in competitive situations). Conversely, if a producer is the first in a frontier area and needs a processing plant built, the midstream company may require a strong MVC and a fee that ensures payoff of the investment, limiting the producer’s options. For instance, early shale gas developments often saw producers dedicating acreage to midstream firms for 15+ years to induce them to build processing and pipelines.
Win-win outcomes: Negotiations typically strive for a mutually beneficial setup. Both parties run economics models during talks – producers model their netback (price of gas and liquids minus fees) to ensure the project is profitable, and midstream model their return on investment given the contract terms. A common middle-ground is a POP contract with a modest fee or minimum, aligning interests. Sometimes producers negotiate a “cost-of-service” trigger – if NGL prices crash so low that POP wouldn’t even cover the processor’s operating cost, the contract might default to a minimum fee to keep the plant running, protecting the processor from operating at a loss (and ensuring the producer’s gas still has an outlet). The negotiation may also involve other services: a midstream might bundle gas gathering, compression, and even residue gas marketing into the agreement. That can simplify things for the producer and justify a slightly higher fee since more value is provided.
Real-World Application – Renegotiation: It’s worth noting that long-term contracts can be revisited by necessity. For example, during the shale revolution, some legacy keep-whole contracts became untenable for producers when NGL values skyrocketed – producers were giving up very valuable liquids for only methane value in return. Some went back to the table to convert those to POP or fee contracts to get a share of the liquids revenue. Similarly, if a processor is struggling (say NGL prices are low and they have mostly POP deals), they might approach producers to restructure fees temporarily to ensure the plant doesn’t shut down (which would hurt producers too). Good business relationships and open communication help in such negotiations. Settlement statements and transparency, as mentioned, also build trust – a producer who clearly sees the processor’s margins will better understand each side’s position when sitting down to talk terms.
In summary, gas processing contracts are a cornerstone of aligning upstream and midstream interests. By combining sound contract structures, careful attention to terms, accurate accounting, and fair negotiations, both producers and processors can thrive – the producer maximizes earnings from both gas and NGLs, and the processor earns a reasonable return for the service and risk taken. These agreements, when done right, enable real-world development of gas resources that might otherwise stay in the ground due to lack of midstream support. Industry professionals navigating these contracts always aim to ensure that the agreement is not only legally sound but also adaptable to real market conditions, thus ensuring long-term, practical success for all parties involved.


​The release of the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report every Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time is a significant event for natural gas futures markets. This report provides data on changes in natural gas storage levels, offering insights into supply and demand dynamics. The market's reaction to this report can vary based on how the actual storage data compares to market expectations.​

Impact on Volatility:

The EIA storage report can lead to increased volatility in natural gas futures prices, especially when the reported storage change deviates from market expectations. An inverse relationship exists between the storage surprise (the difference between actual and expected storage changes) and natural gas futures prices. If the actual storage change is less than expected, indicating tighter supply, prices may rise; if it's more than expected, suggesting looser supply, prices may fall. ​

Magnitude of Price Movements:

The extent of price movements following the EIA report varies. For instance, in one case, the NYMEX September gas futures contract surged about 13 cents to $2.16/MMBtu in the hour immediately following the publication of the EIA's storage report. However, the magnitude of price changes depends on the size of the storage surprise and prevailing market conditions.​
