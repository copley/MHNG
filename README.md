Impact of EIA Natural Gas Inventory Surprises on NYMEX Gas Prices
Overview
The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly natural gas storage report is a key market mover for NYMEX natural gas (NG) futures. Traders closely watch the difference between the expected inventory change and the actual reported change (measured in billion cubic feet, Bcf) because surprises often trigger sharp price moves. In fact, these reports often cause large price swings – for example, on March 19, 2009, a much larger-than-anticipated storage withdrawal sent front-month natural gas futures soaring nearly 13% in one day​
SKIDMORE.EDU
. Such volatility reflects how sensitive gas prices are to unexpected shifts in the supply/demand balance indicated by the storage data.

Historically, natural gas futures move inversely to inventory surprises. A bigger-than-expected build (higher inventory, indicating looser supply/demand) is bearish for prices, while a smaller build or larger withdrawal than expected (lower inventory, indicating a tighter market) is bullish​
IMF.ORG
. The magnitude of the price reaction tends to scale with the surprise: larger deviations between actual and expected storage changes lead to larger price moves​
IMF.ORG
. One study quantified this relationship, finding that a 1% “unexpected” increase in inventory levels typically causes about a 1% drop in NG futures prices, and vice versa​
SKIDMORE.EDU
. In other words, price changes have historically been roughly proportional to the size of the storage surprise in percentage terms.

Not every report causes a major price swing; small surprises often have minimal impact. When the actual inventory change comes in close to consensus expectations, prices might barely budge or just continue their prior trend. For instance, if the report is in line with forecasts, the market reaction can be muted – one recent report saw inventory roughly meet consensus and prices only soften slightly, remaining near multi-year lows​
IG.COM
. On the other hand, when the surprise crosses certain thresholds, the price action becomes much more pronounced. Empirical analysis shows that storage report days are far more volatile on average than normal trading days. One study of 1999–2002 data found the average absolute price change on storage-announcement days was about 3% (in log terms) for the front-month contract, significantly larger than the typical day’s movement​
IMF.ORG
. This underscores that even moderate surprises can move the market by a few percentage points, while major surprises can trigger extreme moves (occasionally well above 5–10% in a single day, as in the 2009 example).

Below, we break down historical price reactions by the size of the inventory deviation, discuss fixed Bcf vs. percentage-based surprise measures, identify key thresholds that tend to produce significant price action, and outline trade strategy insights based on these historical patterns.

Historical Price Reactions vs. Inventory Deviations
Historical data clearly demonstrate an inverse relationship between storage surprises and NG price changes: when the actual change in storage is higher than expected (a bearish “surprise build”), prices tend to fall; when the actual change is lower than expected or a larger draw (a bullish surprise), prices tend to rise​
IMF.ORG
. The strength of the price move correlates with the size of the surprise. Notably, research finds the price response is roughly linear – larger surprises produce proportionally larger moves, without an abrupt jump once a certain size is exceeded​
IMF.ORG
. In other words, a 20 Bcf surprise tends to have about twice the impact of a 10 Bcf surprise (all else equal), rather than, say, four times. There isn’t strong evidence of a strict “cliff” where price sensitivity suddenly changes; instead, each additional Bcf of surprise adds to the price impact in a fairly consistent way​
IMF.ORG
. This means even relatively small deviations can move prices modestly, while very large deviations can cause outsized moves – but the transition is gradual.

Table 1 – Natural Gas Price Reaction vs. Storage Surprise Magnitude (Historical Patterns)

Surprise Magnitude (Actual vs. Expected)	Typical Price Reaction (NYMEX NG)	Historical Observation
Minimal Surprise
(Within ~±5 Bcf or a few % of forecast)	Little to no significant move. Prices may stay flat or only drift slightly (often <1% change).	Considered “in-line” with expectations; often no tradable reaction. For example, an injection very close to consensus saw only a softening of prices​
IG.COM
.
Moderate Surprise
(Roughly ±5–15 Bcf difference, or ~5–15% off forecast)	Moderate reaction. A clear price move in the expected direction (often on the order of 1–3% intraday). Volatility picks up, and initial moves can be faded or extended depending on other factors.	These surprises are big enough to move the needle. E.g. a surprise draw ~10 Bcf larger than expected might push prices up a couple of percent. Market direction is set by the surprise, though other influences (like weather forecasts) can still counteract the move if they are strong​
ENERGYEVIDENCE.BLOGSPOT.COM
.
Large Surprise
(> ±15–20 Bcf difference, or >15–20% off forecast)	Large, rapid price move. Often a sharp spike or drop >3–5% as the market re-prices quickly. Increased volatility and trading volume.	Significant surprises of this scale frequently trigger immediate, pronounced moves. For example, a ~20 Bcf bullish miss (actual much lower than expected) initially sent prices jumping​
ENERGYEVIDENCE.BLOGSPOT.COM
. Such moves can extend throughout the trading session, and occasionally reach double-digit % changes if the surprise is extreme and not offset by other news​

Table 1: The impact of different-sized storage surprises on front-month natural gas futures, based on historical observations. “Surprise” is measured as the difference between the EIA reported change and the market’s expected change (consensus). Percent figures are approximate relative deviations from consensus.

As shown above, small deviations (a few Bcf) rarely provoke more than a shrug from the market. The price change in those cases is usually within normal day-to-day noise. It’s only once the surprise grows to around 10 Bcf or more (depending on context) – typically representing a deviation of 10%+ from the forecasted change – that we start to see a notable directional price move. Surprises in the ±10–15 Bcf range have historically led to front-month price moves on the order of a few pennies up to perhaps 10–20 cents (roughly 1–3%) as traders adjust positions. When the miss gets even larger, exceeding ~20 Bcf or ~20-30% vs. expectations, the price reaction tends to be substantial and immediate, often several percent or more in the minutes after the release. These big surprises are the ones that can set off a flurry of activity and large candle moves on the price chart.

It’s worth noting that the market reaction is symmetric for bullish vs. bearish surprises. A +20 Bcf surprise build (bearish) tends to push prices down with similar magnitude as a –20 Bcf surprise draw (bullish) pushes them up, all else equal. Studies have found no significant difference in how prices respond to positive versus negative storage surprises – what matters is the size of the deviation, not the direction​
IMF.ORG
. In practical terms, traders can expect a big bearish miss to slam prices down just as hard as an equivalent bullish miss would lift them.

Another important observation is how quickly these price reactions occur. Natural gas futures typically adjust within seconds or minutes of the 10:30 a.m. ET report release. Researchers have documented that nearly all of the volatility impact happens immediately as the data comes out and in the first 30 minutes after​
API.MOUNTAINSCHOLAR.ORG
. Prices often gap or jolt right at 10:30, reflecting the surprise, and then continue to fluctuate with high volatility for a short period. This initial window is when the bulk of the “surprise trade” is realized; after that, the market usually settles into a new equilibrium (barring other news). By the end of the trading day, the effect of that morning’s storage surprise is largely fully priced in. There isn’t much evidence of a multi-day trending impact purely from the inventory number itself – the price jump or drop caused by the surprise mostly occurs on announcement day and then mean-reverts or stabilizes unless reinforced by other fundamental trends​

Fixed Bcf vs. Percentage Deviations as Trade Triggers
Should traders use an absolute Bcf difference or a percentage deviation to judge the surprise? Both approaches are used, but historical analysis suggests that percentage-based deviations often provide a more consistent gauge of surprise magnitude across different market conditions. This is because the scale of typical inventory changes varies throughout the year, and an absolute difference of, say, 10 Bcf can be more or less significant depending on the context. For example, a 10 Bcf miss during a summer week (when the expected injection might be 50 Bcf) is a hefty 20% deviation, which is quite significant; but a 10 Bcf miss in peak winter (when a 150 Bcf withdrawal is expected) is under 7%, a relatively smaller surprise in context. Using a percentage metric inherently adjusts for the normal size of the weekly change.

Academic research backs this up by showing that price impact is roughly proportional to the percentage surprise. Gay et al. (2009) found that about a 1% surprise in inventory translates to a 1% price change​
SKIDMORE.EDU
. This proportional relationship means that what really matters is the relative surprise. A fixed threshold (e.g. “trade if the miss is 20 Bcf or more”) can work, but it might overlook big surprises on smaller expected moves or overreact to moderate misses when inventories are changing rapidly. For instance, a 20 Bcf miss when the market only expected a 40 Bcf change is a 50% shock – a huge surprise likely worth trading. But a 20 Bcf miss against a 120 Bcf expectation is around 17%, which, while still important, might not be as earth-shattering. In percentage terms, those two scenarios are very different, even though the absolute miss is the same.

Historically, traders often talk in terms of absolute Bcf surprises, since forecasts and news reports themselves are framed that way (“Actual came in 15 Bcf above estimates,” etc.). Certain rule-of-thumb levels have emerged in market commentary – for example, deviations on the order of 10+ Bcf start to get the market’s attention, and ~20 Bcf or more is seen as a significant miss that will likely move prices noticeably. These ballpark figures are rooted in experience: as noted, a 10 Bcf miss is usually beyond the typical noise range, and 20 Bcf is roughly a 1+ standard deviation surprise in most weeks. In fact, during winter months when storage swings are largest, the standard deviation of analysts’ forecast error is about 13–14 Bcf​
IMF.ORG
; in other seasons it’s lower. So an absolute miss of ~20 Bcf is 1–2 standard deviations away from expectations – a fairly rare event – which explains why it tends to provoke a big reaction. Percentage-based thresholds naturally adjust for these seasonal differences. For example, one might say “a surprise greater than 20% of the expected change” is significant. In summer that could be a smaller absolute Bcf number, in winter a larger one.

From a reliability perspective, percentage deviations are often more robust for triggering trades because they normalize the surprise by the scale of what was expected. A 5 Bcf miss in a low-demand shoulder month (perhaps a 25 Bcf expected change) is a 20% surprise – likely meaningful – whereas that same 5 Bcf in winter (when 5 Bcf is a drop in the bucket of typical changes) is negligible. By using a percentage trigger, you’d catch the first scenario but filter out the second. This prevents false signals in periods of large overall inventory swings. Indeed, studies that analyze price response often measure the surprise in standardized terms (like percent or as a standardized surprise relative to standard deviation) and find consistent correlations with price movement​
SKIDMORE.EDU
​
IMF.ORG
.

That said, absolute Bcf thresholds remain useful in practice, especially when communicating and implementing simple trading rules. Many traders will effectively combine the two approaches: for instance, “If the actual number misses by more than 10 Bcf and at least 15% relative to the forecast, then trade in the direction of the surprise.” In summary, percentage-based measures better capture the contextual significance of a surprise (making them statistically more reliable across varying conditions), while fixed Bcf thresholds are intuitive and can work well during periods when the scale of inventory changes is fairly stable (or if adjusted by season). The historical evidence suggests leaning on relative (percent) surprises for consistency, given the approximately linear price-surprise relationship​
IMF.ORG
, but it doesn’t have to be an either/or choice – using both can add confidence that a surprise is truly outside normal variance.

Key Thresholds for Significant Price Moves
While there isn’t a single magical cutoff that guarantees a big price move, historical patterns reveal threshold ranges beyond which price reactions become much more pronounced. Based on past data and market experience, a few key levels stand out:

“Within Expectations” Zone: 0 to ~5 Bcf difference (or <5% deviation) – Little reaction. Surprises this small are often considered statistical noise. The price may tick up or down a few cents but no clear directional move is attributable to the report. In many cases, if the surprise is this small, traders view the report as essentially neutral. The market often continues to trade on other drivers (like weather or technical momentum) as if nothing major happened. Trade implication: Don’t chase the number if it’s this close to forecasts; historically there’s not enough fuel for a move after transaction costs and volatility.

Notable Miss: ~5–15 Bcf miss (5–15% deviation) – Noticeable but moderate price movement. Surprises in this range usually move prices in the expected direction, though the magnitude might be moderate. It’s common to see a quick price move of 1-2% (several cents) when the storage number misses by, say, around 10 Bcf. For example, if analysts expected a +80 Bcf build and the EIA reports +65 Bcf (a 15 Bcf bullish surprise, ~19% lower build than expected), you might see an initial price spike as shorts cover. Conversely, a moderately bearish miss (actual higher than expected) often knocks prices down a bit. These moves can sometimes set the intraday trend – the market might slowly extend the move to, say, a 2–3% change over the rest of the day – but they are not guaranteed to unleash a huge rally or selloff. Other factors will still play a role. If weather news or other fundamentals align with the direction of the surprise, the move can be amplified; if they conflict, the move might stall or even reverse. Still, historically a miss of this size has tended to provide a tradable signal, as the surprise is clearly outside the margin of error that the market expected. Traders often react, but with some caution.

Significant Surprise: ~15–20 Bcf+ miss (15%+ deviation) – Sharp and significant price move likely. When the inventory number deviates this much or more, the market reaction has typically been swift and sizable. A surprise of this magnitude is uncommon enough that it immediately recalibrates the supply/demand outlook in traders’ minds. Price jumps or drops of 3-5% (or more) on the day have been frequently observed in these cases. For instance, a 20 Bcf bullish surprise (actual draw/injection 20 Bcf tighter than expected) can ignite a strong rally in NG futures, as was seen in a case where a ~20 Bcf miss caused an initial price spike (though subsequent weather news tempered the gains)​
ENERGYEVIDENCE.BLOGSPOT.COM
. On the flip side, a bearish miss of that size can send prices tumbling quickly. These large surprises often come during extreme weather periods or when there is a sudden change in supply/demand that forecasters badly misjudge (such as an unexpected cold blast or a surprise drop in production). In such scenarios, the price reaction in the first few minutes can be dramatic – multiple percentage points – and the market may continue to price in the new information throughout the session. It’s not unusual for a move that starts at 10:30 a.m. to snowball as more traders jump in, especially if key technical levels are broken in the process. Historically, once you get to ~20+ Bcf surprises, it’s a safe bet that the market will have a pronounced reaction, absent any contradictory developments simultaneously. Truly massive surprises (on the order of 30+ Bcf off expectations, which are rare) have triggered some of the biggest single-day moves on record (e.g., double-digit percentage price changes)​
SKIDMORE.EDU
.

In percentage terms, deviations of roughly 20-30% or more from the consensus forecast are the kind of big misses that correspond to those “significant surprise” reactions. Smaller percentage misses (single-digit %) are usually absorbed with minor price adjustments. This perspective is useful because it scales with the expected injection/withdrawal size. For example, a 30 Bcf miss in summer might be a huge 50% surprise, whereas 30 Bcf in winter might be ~15%. The former would likely produce a much bigger price jolt than the latter, and indeed that’s what history shows. By looking at percentage deviation, one could say “a miss greater than ~20%” is a reasonable threshold for a strong likelihood of significant price action.

To summarize the key thresholds: roughly 10 Bcf (~10%) is the line where surprises start to matter noticeably, and around 20 Bcf (~20%+) is where they become market-moving in a big way. These are not hard rules, but guidelines extracted from historical behavior. They help set expectations – e.g., if you see an inventory number come in 3 Bcf off, you wouldn’t expect much fireworks, but if it’s 25 Bcf off, you know to expect a substantial move. Always remember that other factors (like prevailing market trend, weather outlook, or whether the market was positioned long/short ahead of the report) can influence the outcome, but in pure surprise terms, bigger deviations have consistently meant bigger moves.

Trade Entry/Exit Insights from Historical Patterns
Translating these historical reactions into a trading strategy involves timing, trigger criteria, and risk management. Here are some insights on trade entry and exit logic gleaned from the data and past market behavior:

Use Surprise Thresholds as Trade Triggers: Given the above thresholds, a common strategy is to only initiate a trade if the inventory surprise exceeds a certain level. This helps avoid whipsaws on negligible surprises. For example, a trader might decide: “If the actual storage change deviates by more than 10 Bcf (or 15%) from the consensus, I will enter a trade in the direction of the surprise.” In practice, this means going long immediately if the report is significantly more bullish (smaller build or bigger draw than expected), or going short if the report is significantly more bearish (bigger build than expected). Historical analysis supports this approach – trades triggered by substantial surprises have a much higher probability of yielding a profitable move, because the market is more likely to follow through in the direction of the fundamental surprise rather than chopping around. Conversely, if the surprise is below the chosen threshold, it’s often best to stand aside, as price action may be indecisive or dominated by noise. By filtering out small surprises, one avoids many false signals.

Act Quickly (or Even Pre-Position): The reaction time for natural gas futures is extremely fast once the data hits. Prices typically spike within seconds of 10:30 a.m. if the surprise is large. Studies have even observed that informed traders sometimes position in the minutes before the release, anticipating the result​
API.MOUNTAINSCHOLAR.ORG
. For most traders, the practical implication is that you must execute swiftly to capitalize on the surprise. Many will use automated orders or algos triggered by the data release. If you wait even several minutes to evaluate, the initial move may largely be over. Historical volatility data show that the bulk of the move often occurs in the first 5-30 minutes following the announcement​
API.MOUNTAINSCHOLAR.ORG
. Therefore, an effective strategy has been to enter immediately once a qualifying surprise is confirmed. This might mean having preset orders (e.g., a buy stop above the market and a sell stop below the market going into the report, which get activated depending on the number). The key is being in the market quickly to ride the initial wave of the price adjustment.

Target the Immediate Intraday Move: Since, as noted, the price impact of a storage surprise is usually fully reflected by the end of the trading day​
API.MOUNTAINSCHOLAR.ORG
, trading strategies often focus on a same-day exit. A classic approach is to take profits by the market’s close (or even within an hour or two) after the release, once the impulse from the news has played out. Historically, that’s when the edge from the inventory information is highest. Holding a position beyond that reintroduces exposure to other factors (overnight weather model updates, etc.) that could erase the gains from the inventory trade. Many traders will therefore use intraday profit targets or trailing stops to capture the move. For example, if prices jump 5% on a bullish surprise, one might scale out of the long position during that rally, rather than assuming the trend will continue for days. The data suggests that the incremental effect of the surprise after day 1 is minimal – futures markets are efficient in pricing it in​
IMF.ORG
. So, a prudent strategy is to treat the inventory trade as a short-term catalyst play, not a long-term position (unless the surprise changes your broader fundamental view and you choose to carry that bias forward).

Recognize When Surprises Fail to Move the Market: On occasion, you may see a sizable surprise yet a muted price reaction. This typically means other dominant factors are at play. For instance, there have been instances where a bullish inventory draw didn’t rally the market because weather forecasts turned extremely warm at the same moment, overwhelming the bullish storage news. A historical example noted earlier saw an initially bullish 20 Bcf storage miss get “faded” as updated mild weather outlooks hit the wires, causing the price spike to evaporate​
ENERGYEVIDENCE.BLOGSPOT.COM
. If you enter on a surprise and the price does not respond as expected within a short time, that’s a signal to be cautious. It may indicate that the surprise was already priced in or offset by something else. Effective trade logic includes an exit plan if the anticipated move doesn’t materialize quickly. For instance, one might use a time-based stop (e.g., “if the market hasn’t moved in my favor within 15 minutes, cut the trade”) or a tight stop loss just beyond the pre-announcement price level. Historical patterns show that when a genuine surprise occurs, the market usually moves promptly; if it stagnates, reevaluate the context.

Symmetric Strategy (Long or Short): As mentioned, the price response is symmetric for bullish vs bearish surprises​
IMF.ORG
. A sound trade plan should be willing to go long on a bullish surprise or short on a bearish surprise with equal readiness. Don’t let a personal bias (e.g. “I’m bullish on gas in general”) prevent you from trading the bearish side of a surprise – the historical data indicates short trades on bearish storage surprises have been just as effective as long trades on bullish surprises, given similar magnitude. The key is the surprise relative to expectations, not the absolute direction of inventory change. Having a predefined plan for both scenarios ensures you can react whichever way the number goes.

Combine with Technical Levels for Exits: While the entry trigger is fundamentally driven (the surprise), it can help to use technical analysis to guide exits. Often, the post-report price will run until it hits a notable support/resistance level or retracement. Checking a price chart, you might identify, for example, a previous day’s high, a moving average, or a Fibonacci level as a possible target to take profit. Historically, if a surprise is big enough, it can push price through technical levels, leading to even larger moves as stop orders are tripped. But if the price stalls at a known resistance (despite a bullish surprise), that could be an opportunity to take profit or tighten stops. In essence, marrying the historical fundamental reaction with technical cues can improve trade management. History shows the initial move is fundamentally driven, but the extent can be influenced by technical breakouts or lack thereof.

Learn from the Statistics: Some quantitative traders have even calculated average price responses per Bcf of surprise to set expectations for trade targets. For example, if over a long period the data shows “on average, price moves 0.5 cents per Bcf of surprise” (just as an illustration), a 20 Bcf surprise might imply about a 10-cent expected move. While every week is different, this kind of analysis can help in sizing positions and profit expectations. The earlier cited study (Gay et al. 2009) essentially gave an elasticity of ~1% price per 1% inventory surprise​
SKIDMORE.EDU
. Traders might use such a metric to estimate how far price could go given a surprise of X%. In practice, however, the relationship can have a lot of scatter, so it’s used as a rough guide rather than a strict rule. Still, knowing the ballpark of historical reactions can prevent overreacting or underreacting – e.g., if a 5 Bcf surprise historically only moves gas 1%, one wouldn’t rationally expect a 5% move from such a surprise unless other factors amplify it.

In summary, the most effective trade logic based on historical evidence is: be selective (trade only when the surprise is meaningful), act fast, go with the direction of the surprise, and take profits relatively quickly. This strategy has yielded good results historically because it aligns with how the market processes the new information. It capitalizes on the immediate repricing that usually occurs, without overstaying the trade. Of course, risk controls are vital – even a historically sound strategy can encounter exceptions. Using reasonable stop losses (volatility is high after the report) and position sizing such that a surprise outside your trigger (or an unexpected market response) doesn’t blow up the account is essential. But the guiding principle remains: big surprises beget big moves, and those are the situations where a trader wants to be involved, whereas small surprises can be ignored.

Conclusion
Historical analysis of NYMEX natural gas futures around EIA storage releases reveals clear patterns: price moves tend to be proportional to the size of the inventory surprise, and significant deviations between expected and actual storage changes often lead to sharp, short-term price movements. By examining past reactions, we identified that absolute surprises on the order of ~10+ Bcf (or roughly >10% of the expected change) are typically needed to generate a noteworthy price response, with very large surprises (~20 Bcf or >20%) reliably causing pronounced volatility and directional moves.

In deciding how to act on storage reports, using percentage-based surprise thresholds provides a consistent measure across varying market conditions (scaling with the typical inventory change), whereas fixed Bcf thresholds offer simple rules of thumb for different regimes. Both approaches point to similar key levels where price action becomes significant. For practical trading, the most successful strategies have been those that trigger off these sizable surprises – entering long/short in line with the surprise – and focus on capturing the immediate move. The historical record shows that trades initiated on meaningful surprises and closed out within the day have a high success rate, as the market rapidly incorporates the new information​
API.MOUNTAINSCHOLAR.ORG
​
IMF.ORG
. Small surprises, on the other hand, tend not to produce enough movement to justify a trade after accounting for noise and transaction costs.

Finally, while history is a valuable guide, traders should remain vigilant to the broader context each week. Inventory data does not exist in a vacuum – weather forecasts, production trends, and other news can modulate or override the price impact. Nonetheless, knowing the historical benchmarks for how natural gas prices react to inventory deviations gives a powerful framework for decision-making. It helps one distinguish signal from noise on report days and formulate a trading plan accordingly. In essence: when the EIA storage surprise is big, pay close attention and be ready to act; when it’s small, patience (and staying on the sidelines) is often the better part of valor. By aligning trade entry/exit logic with the proven historical tendencies outlined above, traders can improve their odds of success in navigating the volatility of weekly natural gas storage reports.

Note: All price reactions and thresholds are derived from historical market data and academic studies. They serve as general guidelines – actual future reactions may vary with market conditions.


Below is a high-level overview of the approximate frequency and probability of different storage surprise “tiers” (minimal, moderate, large) and some guidance on what success rates historically looked like for short-term or “scalp” trades that followed these surprises. Keep in mind that these are broad, ballpark figures based on historical data. Actual probabilities and frequency can vary by season, the broader commodity environment, and how precisely one defines each surprise threshold.

1. Frequency of Surprise Events
1) Minimal Surprise

Definition: Within ±5 Bcf of consensus (or <5% deviation).
Occurrence Rate: Historically, this happens roughly 30–40% of the time.
Rationale: Analyst consensus forecasts are frequently near the actual EIA figure, especially in fairly predictable shoulder-season weeks. Some weeks, the market is surprisingly accurate (e.g., a 2–3 Bcf difference only).
2) Moderate Surprise

Definition: ±5–15 Bcf difference (or ~5–15% deviation).
Occurrence Rate: Typically ~40–50% of all weekly reports.
Rationale: Differences in weather model updates, LNG flows, and production data often cause moderate misalignments between forecasts and the reported number.
3) Large Surprise

Definition: >±15 or 20 Bcf difference (or >15–20% deviation).
Occurrence Rate: Historically ~10–20% of the time.
Rationale: A large surprise typically requires a significant new weather event or a big mismatch in supply/demand assumptions. These are rarer but can happen a handful of times each season, often in winter or times of abrupt supply disruption.
Because there are ~52 storage reports each year, you might see 5–10 big surprises in a typical year (some years more, some years less), while most are in the moderate range. Minimal surprises might account for 15–20 reports per year, where the market reaction is usually too small to meaningfully trade.

2. Probability of Strategy Success
When Trading on Large Surprises
Entry Logic: Suppose you only take trades when the reported figure deviates from consensus by at least ±15 Bcf (or 20% of the forecast).
Historical Success Rate: Many anecdotal and some academic analyses suggest that the price “follows” the surprise direction at least 70–80% of the time in the immediate aftermath (the first 30 minutes or so).
Why? Because a big surprise quickly reprices fundamentals. The market usually moves in the expected direction and continues for at least a brief period.
Scalping Probability: Scalp trades (looking for a quick, small profit) can see success rates in the 60–75% range—some traders report even higher, depending on their entry/exit discipline.
When Trading on Moderate Surprises
Entry Logic: Trigger a trade when deviation is ±5–15 Bcf (or 5–15% of forecast).
Historical Success Rate: The market still tends to move in the direction of the surprise but is more prone to quick reversals, possibly due to other simultaneous factors (e.g., short-term weather).
Traders might see a 60–65% success rate in capturing an initial move before it stalls or reverses.
Scalping Probability: Possibly a 50–60% successful scalp outcome, as many moderate surprises are partially priced in or overshadowed by other developments.
When Trading on Minimal Surprises
Entry Logic: If the difference is less than 5 Bcf (or 5% deviation), the market reaction is often muted.
Historical Success Rate: This scenario typically does not have enough momentum to scalp effectively.
The success rate is often no better than a coin toss (50%) and can be lower once you factor in slippage/spread.
3. Considerations That Affect These Probabilities
Market Condition: Bull or bear market regimes can skew responses, e.g., in a strongly bullish environment, even a moderate draw can spark oversized moves.
Weather News: Surprises coinciding with a major weather change can either amplify or negate the price move.
Time of Year: Winter has larger average storage changes, so absolute Bcf surprises might be bigger but represent a smaller % deviation. Conversely, in summer, a 10 Bcf difference is more significant proportionally.
Volatility & Liquidity: Higher implied volatility can lead to bigger intraday swings, improving scalp opportunities. Lower liquidity can mean slippage.
Backtesting & Real Execution: Live execution slippage and partial fills can lower success rates compared to backtests that assume perfect fills.
4. Summary
Large Surprises (~10–20% of reports): Historically produce the highest-probability trade setups with success rates often in the 70%+ range for immediate, direction-following scalps.
Moderate Surprises (~40–50% of reports): Some tradable reactions, but success rates can drop to 60% or less, due to smaller follow-through and more frequent whipsawing.
Minimal Surprises (~30–40% of reports): Typically not worth trading, with outcomes akin to random noise.
Overall, if you systematically code a scalping strategy that only triggers on large surprises and executes quickly, you might expect a 60–80% success rate on those trades, though real-world factors (slippage, news offsets) might lower that probability. Keep in mind these are broad historical tendencies, not guarantees, and your actual results will depend on your specific trade execution details and real-time risk management.

EIA Natural Gas Inventory Report Timing
Reasoned for 59 seconds
In a typical week, the EIA publishes its U.S. natural gas storage report every Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). If Thursday falls on a major holiday (e.g., Thanksgiving) or the federal government is closed, the release is usually shifted by one day (to Wednesday or Friday, depending on the holiday schedule).

Here’s the usual schedule:

Regular Weeks:

Thursday, 10:30 a.m. ET
Holiday Weeks (e.g., Thanksgiving, certain federal holidays):

May shift to Wednesday, 12:00 p.m. ET, or Friday, 10:30 a.m. ET—the EIA will announce schedule changes in advance.
Traders often position themselves or set automated strategies to react right at 10:30 a.m. ET each Thursday when the number comes out. That’s the critical moment to capitalize on any surprise in the reported inventories.

Since New Zealand operates in New Zealand Standard Time (NZST) or New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) (during daylight saving), here’s how the EIA Natural Gas Storage Report time converts:

Regular Schedule (Non-Holiday Weeks)
USA Release Time: Thursday, 10:30 a.m. ET
NZST (Standard Time - April to September): Friday, 4:30 a.m. NZST
NZDT (Daylight Saving - September to April): Friday, 5:30 a.m. NZDT
Holiday-Shifted Schedule (If Moved to Wednesday or Friday)
If moved to Wednesday, 12:00 p.m. ET:
Thursday, 6:00 a.m. NZST (Standard Time)
Thursday, 7:00 a.m. NZDT (Daylight Time)
If moved to Friday, 10:30 a.m. ET:
Saturday, 4:30 a.m. NZST (Standard Time)
Saturday, 5:30 a.m. NZDT (Daylight Time)
Key Takeaways
Most weeks, the report comes out early Friday morning in NZ (4:30 a.m. or 5:30 a.m., depending on the season).
During daylight saving months (September–April), it's one hour later (5:30 a.m.).
During standard time months (April–September), it's 4:30 a.m.
To trade it effectively in New Zealand, you’d need to be awake and ready to execute around 4:20–4:30 a.m. (NZST) or 5:20–5:30 a.m. (NZDT) on Friday mornings.
